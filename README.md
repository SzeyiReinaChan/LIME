# Enhancing Model Interpretability with Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) for Religion Dataset Analysis
###Szeyi Chan

Few things to note:
- To run the code, please run the ```explainer.py``` file. The code will generate the explanations for the Religion dataset.
- To get the overlap between the explanations, please run the ```overlap.py``` file. The code will generate the ```feature_overlap_results.txt``` file. Make sure run the report AFTER running the ```explainer.py``` file.
- The data is stored in the ```data``` folder, and should already unzip the tar.gz file to access the data.
