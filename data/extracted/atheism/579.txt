Drinking Skeptically is an informal social event designed to promote fellowship
and networking among skeptics, critical-thinkers, and like-minded individuals.

Drinking Skeptically provides an opportunity for skeptics to talk, share ideas
(and yes, drink*) in a casual, relaxed atmosphere. We discuss the issues of the
day and whatever else is on our minds. But most of all, we have fun while
promoting skepticism, science, and rationality.

Don't drink? Don't let that stop you from joining us! Some of the world's most
famous skeptics are teetotallers, and we are happy to have you!

Visiting from out of town? Stop on by! Skeptics are a friendly bunch and
there's always room for one more.

*Remember that drinking skeptically means drinking responsibly. If there's one
thing science has taught us, it's the effects of alcohol on the human body.
