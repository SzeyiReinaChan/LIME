Iron Chariots is intended to provide information on apologetics and
counter-apologetics. We'll be collecting common arguments and providing
responses, information and resources to help counter the glut of misinformation
and poor arguments which masquerade as evidence for religious claims.

The complexity of issues surrounding religion ensures that any proper
assessment requires us to delve into a number of philosophical, historical and
sociological topics. Our ultimate goal is to provide a robust and definitive
resource for:

  • atheists seeking           • apologists who feel that their
    responses to common          "pet" argument is above reproach
    apologetic arguments       • individuals of any philosophical
  • theists who are              ideal who have an interest in
    questioning the efficacy     religious studies
    of their beliefs
