What is Humanism?

Humanism is a rational philosophy informed by science, inspired by art, and
motivated by compassion.

Affirming the dignity of each human being, it supports individual liberty and
opportunity consonant with social and planetary responsibility.

It advocates the extension of democracy and the expansion of the open society,
standing for human rights and social justice.

Free of supernaturalism, it recognizes human beings as a part of nature and
holds that values -- be they religious, ethical, social, or political -- have
their source in human nature, experience, and culture.

Humanism thus derives the goals of life from human needs and interests rather
than from theological or ideological abstractions, and asserts that humanity
must take responsibility for its own destiny.

Applying Critical Thinking to the Internet

    Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is
    those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively
    assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.
