Who are the Sisters?

The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence® is a leading-edge Order of queer nuns.
Since our first appearance in San Francisco on Easter Sunday, 1979, the Sisters
have devoted ourselves to community service, ministry and outreach to those on
the edges, and to promoting human rights, respect for diversity and spiritual
enlightenment. We believe all people have a right to express their unique joy
and beauty and we use humor and irreverent wit to expose the forces of bigotry,
complacency and guilt that chain the human spirit.


A Nun on Your Side

 Though Sisters always want you to indulge when it comes to life (heck, it's
 part of our name, you know), nevertheless you want you to do it (whatever it
 is) safely. Below are some of our on-going campaigns that aim to keep you
 safe and, remember, you always
 have a nun on your side.
