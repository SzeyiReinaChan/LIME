To bring together atheists, agnostics and other freethinkers. What with this
nation leaning towards becoming more religious, those of us who reject religion
need to organize and combine our strengths. Even in a society that is supposed
to be open and accepting, all too often we have to keep our atheism under wraps
lest we be made pariahs.
