The Black Church, Black Secular Community, and Social Justice

We will discuss the black church, black secular community and its claim of the
social justice mantle. Everybody wants to claim that they marched with MLK and
had tea with MalcolmX. Was that really the case? Let's talk about this and
more. Were the Black Power Movement and Civil Rights Movement started and
maintained by the black church? Were the Black Power Movement and Civil Rights
Movement started and maintained by the secular community? Were these movements
supported and funded by the black church? What percentage? ...and more... How
were black womens issues handled by the church? Were they supportive or
patriarchal in approach? Although women started, funded and maintained these
movements, they were pushed to the back. Current movements are being
spearheaded by women. Is that why the response has been dismal from the black
church? Is that why the response has been dismal from the black community? Is
that why the response has been dismal from the black secular community? Is the
old Civil Rights Vanguard attempting to co-opt these movements from the young
people who started them? This movement is inclusive of ALL BLACK LIVES. Is that
why you some black men rejecting it? Do they believe that the focus should be
on Black men and then they will help the women? Are we falling for that trick
again? That and more.
