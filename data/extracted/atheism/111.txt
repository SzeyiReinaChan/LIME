                   Welcome to The Skeptic Tank's WEB Pages!

Fred Rice

You have loaded The Skeptic Tank's information WEB pages. This web site is
dedicated to the scientific investigation of claims of the paranormal with side
issues in to the critical examination of the consequences of unreason.

Generally we do not look in to untestable claims (which includes religion and
deity constructs) since such beliefs fall outside of testability and thus
outside of falsifiability, something which science does not address outside of
human behavioral sciences.

The intent of this web site is not to mock or ridicule honest beliefs but to
debunk and expose bunko claims through scientific methodology, and to examine
the consequences of unreason.

Whether it's flying saucers, Roswell Aliens, Bigfoot, astrology, quack medical
notions, or whatever you find here, you may find some of the information
contained on the web site to be offensive however the intent is not to be
offensive. The intent is to examine and expose the testable claims which are
demonstrably false (doing so without undue ridicule) and the truth about
deeply-held though inaccurate falsifiable beliefs is often enough to anger
people who believe such things.

The Skeptic Tank welcomes feedback which is why an email address for the
Chairman of The Skeptic Tank is offered at the bottom of every web page. We
encourage feedback and correction on anything that we provide here -- with our
thanks.

Please note that a great many web pages on The Skeptic Tank have been written
by third-party individuals, and each web page's statements and opinions are
those of the individuals identified in the pages, some of which will not be the
same as the opinions held by anyone on The Skeptic Tank staff of volunteers.

I do radio and telephone interviews and on rare occasion I will do a television
interview or an on-line chat interview. Just send me email at least five days
ahead of time and I would be delighted to call in to your show (or otherwise
participate) if your show covers the realm of claims of the paranormal or if
your show is related to anything involving scientific skepticism. The sole
exception is FOX News which I will not respond to.
