We are a community dedicated to fostering ethical humanist beliefs and values
and to improving the human condition through individual and collective action.
We celebrate diversity and welcome newcomers of all faiths, color, sexual
orientations, and nationalities - anyone who agrees with the idea that we need
to help in making the world a better, more ethical place.


We have activities and events for all age groups. Among our activities are a
Sunday School, a teen group, and for adults we have social gatherings, Sunday
morning meetings, lectures, and discussion groups on movies, opera, and world
events.

Projects of the Society include a branch of Amnesty International, the Our
Times Coffeehouse, Ethical Friends of Children, whose sole purpose is to help
children by providing them with needed clothing and infant furniture, and the
Kenya Project - supporting the Sema Academy elementary school.

The Ethical Society Children's Ethics Program seeks to affirm the special worth
of every human being and to encourage the development of those values which
integrate each child into the greater human family. By identifying ethics as
central to religion, children are encouraged to explore their own values and
beliefs, with Ethical Culture values emphasized throughout Sunday morning
lessons.
