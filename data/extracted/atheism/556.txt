  • Join us!

Atheists, agnostics, freethinkers, humanists, non-religious, lost tourists, and
the open-minded and supportive are all welcome to join us! We, like anyone, can
benefit from a supportive community. It is often claimed that atheists are rare
when in fact nearly 20% of our nation's population do not believe in a higher
power. Still, atheists can on occasion feel isolated when the religious
community is so organized and outspoken on issues. We deserve a voice. Building
and participating in a community is the first step in giving us that voice. On
a plus side, the conversation is great! Aside from our traditional social
Sunday meetups we also organize volunteer events - please join us and if you
have an idea for something fun to do please make a suggestion!
