We are the Boston Area Chapter of the American Humanist Association. Basically,
we are the people living in the Boston Metropolitan area (extending into New
Hampshire and Rhode Island) who believe in Humanism and try to live a
Humanistic life and who like to get together in association with each other in
formal or informal humanistically oriented activities. The pages of this web
site will describe what these activities and associations and services
currently are. We are governed by our Chapter By-Laws. We hope that you are
able to make use of them and that you will join with us on occasion.
