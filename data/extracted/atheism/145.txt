RS 150 - Elizabeth Loftus on "The malleability of human memory"

Release date: January 10, 2016

[320px-Eliz]Elizabeth Loftus

Do you remember when you were a kid, and you had that great day at Disneyland
where you got to meet Bugs Bunny? No? Think harder. It was a sunny day... 

In this episode of Rationally Speaking, Julia interviews psychologist Elizabeth
Loftus, whose pioneering work on human memory revealed that our memories can be
contaminated by the questions people ask us, or by misinformation we encounter
after the fact -- even to the point of making us remember entire events that
never could have happened. (Like meeting Bugs Bunny, a Warner Bros character,
at Disneyland.)

RS 149 - Susan Gelman on "How essentialism shapes our thinking"

Release date: December 13, 2015

[audio_mp3_]

[Gelman_Sus]Susan GelmanIn this episode, psychologist Susan Gelman describes
her work on the psychological trait of essentialism: the innate human urge to
categorize reality and to assume that those categories reflect meaningful,
invisible differences. Julia and Susan discuss why the discovery of
essentialism in children was such a surprise to scientists, how the language we
use affects the way we view reality, and whether essentialism is to blame for
bad philosophy.
