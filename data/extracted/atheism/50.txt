                                 know by now that last week
                                 we were hit with an intense
                                 DDoS attack.  I've created
                                 a fundraiser so that you
                                 can send hackers (likely
                                 religious) a message: Your
                                 attacks on RRS,

                                 We incurred costs to
                                 mitigate the effects of a
                                 DDoS attack however there
                                 is more we can do.  Please
                                 show me that you have my
                                 back and chip in a few
                                 dollars.  It's the first
                                 time I've asked in 2 or 3
                                 years.

                                 contradictions are
                                 metaphorical?

                                 What if we could show you
                                 that the God of the bible
                                 lied?

                                 Do you think that god is
                                 all loving?

                                 If god is infinite, is he
                                 also hate?

                                 If god is the creator of
                                 all things is he not the
                                 creator of evil as well?

                                 If god is infinite isn't
                                 god love and hate at the
                                 same time?

                                 Why do you think god would
                                 create something that he
                                 knew ahead of time would
                                 occur? Why would he subject
                                 himself to that?

                                 If god is all knowing then
                                 god knows before certain
                                 people come into existence
                                 that they are going to hell
                                 when they die. He knew
                                 about it before he created
                                 the Universe.
                                 God is all knowing
                                 therefore he knows ahead of
                                 time who is going to hell
                                 and who is going to heaven.
                                 Certain people were born
                                 with god knowing they were
                                 going to hell. It's hard to
                                 reconcile that with all
                                 loving. Would you create a
                                 child if you knew in
                                 advance that child was
                                 going to go to hell? (LONG

                                 Are there bad parts in the
                                 bible? In Leviticus there
                                 are things you are supposed
                                 to kill your children for,
                                 and the new testament tells
                                 you that you can be
                                 forgiven for these things.

                                 An atheist that lives a
                                 decent good life he'll go
                                 to hell but a death row
                                 inmate who repents will go
                                 to heaven.

                                 Why should the King James
                                 bible be used? The other
                                 bibles are made to fix the
                                 "errors" in the bible. The
                                 manuscripts contradict each
                                 other. There is no original
                                 one copy of the bible.

                                 Deutoronomy 12:30, 6:15,
                                 2:25
                                 Deutoronomy 17:2-7... Rook
                                 interprets to mean that

                                 hosts should be stoned to
                                 death.

                                 Lawrence interprets the
                                 passage to mean this only
                                 applies before Jesus came.

                                 Rook responds with Matthew
                                 23:2-3 John 7:19 and Mark
                                 1:44 to explain that Jesus
                                 said you must abide by all
                                 of the old testament.

                                 We then cover Isaiah 45:7
                                 KJV in which god I form the
                                 light and create darkness.
                                 I make peace and create
                                 evil, I the lord do all
                                 these things. We then cover
                                 the difference of this
                                 passage in 3 different
                                 bibles and how it's sugar
                                 coated in other newer
                                 versions of the bibles.

                                 There are people that blame
                                 the bad things on this
                                 planet on atheists, gays,
                                 and satan. Meanwhile the
                                 bible clearly states it's
                                 the lord that does these
                                 things.

                                 At 53:30 Lawrence admits
                                 there is a flaw in the
                                 bible, but it doesn't mean
                                 much.

                                 Paraphrasing Lawrence at 58
                                 minutes: In order to
                                 believe in the Invisible
                                 Pink Unicorn, you need to
                                 start by believing in the
                                 Invisible Pink Unicorn.

                                 Why do I have to please an
                                 infinite being? He doesn't
                                 need to be pleased, he's
                                 infinite.

                                 It's reading the bible that
                                 led us away from it. Rook
                                 wanted to become a Priest a
                                 few years before the
                                 recording of the show. He
                                 was willing to give up sex
                                 for god, so he really
                                 believed! 1:01:45

                                 Lawrence can see where
                                 we're coming from and can
                                 understand why the bible
                                 pushed us away but he can't
                                 ever do that.

                                 Jesus says in Luke 14:26 If
                                 any man come to me, and
                                 hate not his father, and
                                 mother, and wife, and
                                 children, and brethren, and
                                 sisters, yea, and his own
                                 life also, he cannot be my
                                 disciple.

                                 Lawrence responds by
                                 bringing up a version of
                                 the bible that someone
                                 changed to have a totally
                                 different sugar coated
                                 meaning.

                                 1:07 the bible says if you
                                 have the faith you can move
                                 mountains, but nobody has
                                 ever moved a mountain with
                                 their faith. Lawrence says
                                 it's more of a spiritual
                                 thing.

                                 Jesus committed witchcraft
                                 (against Levitican law) by
                                 cursing a tree so that no
                                 fig could ever grow from it
                                 again.

                                 Ok fine Lawrence all of
                                 these things are metaphors.
                                 How do we tell the
                                 difference between literal
                                 and metaphors. Just the
                                 parts are bullshit aren't
                                 literal.

                                 1:13 Lawrence can't accept
                                 this stuff because it's a
                                 faith killer. "Exactly"
                                 Lawrence says.

                                 Matthew 10:34 (at 1:15):
                                 Think not that I am come to
                                 send peace on earth: I came
                                 not to send peace, but a
                                 sword. For I am come to set
                                 a man at variance against
                                 his father, and the
                                 daughter against her
                                 mother, and the daughter in
                                 law against her mother in
                                 law.

                                 (at 1:17) Lawrence has an
                                 aunt that's an atheist, is
                                 she less moral than him? He
                                 doesn't admit that she is
                                 or isn't.

                                 Lawrence claims to be
                                 unwavered by the

                                 the many ancient gods of

                                 vengeful and capricious. If

                                 I think that God in
                                 creating man somewhat
                                 overestimated his

                                 "Atheism is not a
                                 philosophy; it is not even
                                 a view of the world; it is
                                 simply an admission of the
                                 obvious. In fact, 'atheist'
                                 is a term that should not
                                 ever exist. No one ever
                                 needs to identify himself
                                 as a 'non astrologer' or a
                                 'non-alchemist'. We do not
                                 have words for people who
                                 doubt that Elvis is still
                                 alive or that aliens
                                 traversed the galaxy only
                                 to molest ranchers and
                                 their cattle. Atheism is
                                 nothing more than the
                                 noises reasonable people

                                 beliefs. An atheist is
                                 simply a person who
                                 believes that the 260

                                 can still hold to the idea
                                 that the Bible is an
                                 infallible Book, that it
                                 contains no linguistic

                                 and literary criticism have
                                 taken the magic out of the
                                 Bible and have made it a

                                 existence of thousands of

                                 it impossible to hold the
                                 doctrine of a book verbally
                                 infallible. Some might

                                 infallible character, but
                                 this view only begs the
                                 question and makes such

                                 when someone points out the
                                 lies of another person, the

                                 rather than abashed. Never
                                 is this more apparent than
                                 when the lie pointed out is
                                 a lie to oneself, and the
