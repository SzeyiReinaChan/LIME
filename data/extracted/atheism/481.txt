Downeast Humanists & Freethinkers celebrated its 10th anniversary on January 1,
2015! We meet in Ellsworth on the 1st Saturday of every month at 3:30 pm;
upstairs at the Maine Grind. We are an Affiliate of the American Humanist
Association.

Our mission: To provide a forum for discussing issues of common interest and
concern to humanists and freethinkers, and to promote in the larger community
the ideas of humanism and free thought.

Does this describe you?

Humanists believe that, using reason and compassion, we can live ethical and
fulfilling lives. We don't look to supernatural explanations or divine
intervention to solve the problems of humanity and the planet.

Freethinkers form opinions on the basis of evidence, as opposed to tradition,
authority, or dogma.
