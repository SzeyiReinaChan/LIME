The Atheist Doctor Ep. 4: Hypocrisy of the Church

In this episode, I just made some comments on the recent news that's been
circulating in the social media sites recently.  First, a minister caught with
a lawyer's wife in a motel room and their epic answer on why they were there.
 Second, CBCP president asked Filipinos not to condemn suspects involved in
multi-billion pork barrel scam.  Third, a priest caught on video shaming an
unwed young woman during her child's baptismal ceremony.  I also mentioned some
notable documentaries to watch and book to read on the the hypocrisies and
scandals of the church relating to sex.
Here are my sources for the articles mentioned in the podcast:

The Atheist Doctor Ep. 3: Coming Out Of The Atheist Closet

Do your friends and loved ones know that you are an atheist?  If not, why
haven't you come out to them?  In this episode, I share some of the reasons why
I think Filipinos fear coming out of the atheist closet, my own personal coming
out story, funny reactions I got when I tell people I'm an atheist, and some
tips on how to talk about your nonbelief to your loved ones.

The Atheist Doctor Ep. 2: Do Atheist Doctors Hasten Death of Patients?

Do atheist doctors hasten the death of their patients, especially those who are
terminally ill?  The study by Professor Clive Seale, published in Journal of
Medical Ethics, seem to say so.  The study was also mentioned in an article in
The Guardian entitled "Atheist doctors' more likely to hasten death".

Is The Guardian justified in using this title for the article?

The Atheist Doctor also shares some of her experiences working as a doctor
dealing with patients who are at their last stages of life.
