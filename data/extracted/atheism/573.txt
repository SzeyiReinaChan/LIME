The Secular Humanists of Everett is a progressive humanist group dedicated to
promoting positive Humanism.

Being active in our community should be important to us as Humanists.  We
should focus on the positive aspect of Humanism a portray a more favorable
image of activism if we are to make Humanism truly accepted in mainstream
America in the future.

With this in mind the group will promote more activism within it's members.
