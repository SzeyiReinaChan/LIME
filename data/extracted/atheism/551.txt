What if Carl Sagan, Penn & Teller, and the Amazing Randi joined the Rat Pack?
Imagine that, and you'll get a good idea of the Knoxville Skeptics! Rollicking
conversations, high spirits, frosty beverages, and fine eats. Topics and
conversations can go anywhere! Everyone is welcomed! KNOXVILLE SKEPTICS:
"Keeping reason and common sense lighthearted since May 2007!"

We're 162 Skeptics
