Welcome to the Freethought Society (FS)!

The Freethought Society (FS) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, educational
organization advocating the separation of church & state, freedom of religion
for all, freedom from religious intrusion, freedom of expression and freedom of
choice.  As freethinkers, our minds are not constrained by superstitions or
prescribed dogmas that tell us what we may or may not think.  We are a group of
atheists, agnostics, humanists, skeptics, et al. who are interested in
preserving the wall of separation between religion and government.  We value
critical thinking, the power of reason, we reject superstition/religious
dogma. 

FS advocates nontheist thinking because we have looked at the many theological
systems that have been around since the beginning of time, and we have found
them lacking.  The goals of the Freethought Society are to raise awareness and
acceptance of the non-theist community and provide fellowship and unique
services to non-theists throughout the US and Canada.

Through a variety of events and activities, as well as monthly program meetings
, FS serves as a  forum in which freethinkers can learn, socialize and exchange
ideas.

Our services include:

  • Meetings - monthly, free & open to public (Social and Educational)
  • Our bi-monthly newsletter, freely available by pdf to members and all
    interested. Just send an email to newsletter@FtSociety.org to add your name
    to the distribution list.
  • You can learn more about the Freethought Society’s many services and
    programs by visiting our website at www.ftsociety.org.
  • Would you like to volunteer and work with us? Email
    volunteers@ftsociety.org for more information or to sign up.
