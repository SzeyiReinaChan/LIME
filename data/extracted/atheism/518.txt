This is the official Meetup of New York City Skeptics, an all-volunteer
nonprofit that promotes science and critical thinking.

  • For more information about us and our other activities visit
    www.nycskeptics.org.
  • You may also be interested in our official podcast, Rationally Speaking.
  • We also organize the Northeast Conference on Science & Skepticism (NECSS).

Had enough of astrologers, psychics, homeopaths, and spirit channelers?
Yearning to talk with someone rational for awhile? Join us for our mothly
discussion on critical thinking, science, and skeptical inquiry. Make sure you
RSVP promptly, seating will be limited!

To keep the meetups friendly though, we will continue to, at least try, to stay
away from controversial topics. The forbidden topics are religion, politics and
global warming.
