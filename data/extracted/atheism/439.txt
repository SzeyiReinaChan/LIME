We all are ATHEISTS AGNOSTICS, FREETHINKERS, HUMANISTS, but not all at the same
time :-). That is a short way to say none of us believe in the god of the book.
We think reason and science are all that we humans need to solve life's many
problems. 

We do believe fellowship with those who think as we do is a good thing. We hope
you will join us. Please read our "About" section (http://www.meetup.com/
secularhumanism-1/abo...) and answer our few questions - we'll be happy to have
you. But PLEASE answer those questions because if you do not we cannot admit
you..

If you enjoy socializing with folks who hold views that match yours we will
provide lots of opportunities for you to do just that. BUT...

YOU MUST READ WHAT WE ASK YOU TO READ AND ANSWER OUR FEW QUESTIONS OR YOU WILL
NOT BE ADMITTED TO MEMBERSHIP!!!! Please elaborate on any "Yes" or "No"
answers.
