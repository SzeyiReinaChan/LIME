Welcome to the Houston Atheists, the world's largest atheist community!



The Houston Atheists is a growing group of freethinking people who have come
together as a community to offer its members opportunities for social
networking, education, and community service. Every month we have a full
calendar of activities all over Houston and the surrounding areas, including
educational seminars, dinners, coffee socials, happy hour gatherings,
star-gazing events, holiday parties, movies, sports/games, hiking and camping,
as well as kid-friendly family get-togethers at the zoo, museum, and beach.



In addition to the meetups, the Houston Atheists also host a Facebook site
where members network and share information 24/7.



Also available for membership is the newly-formed Houston Atheists Association,
which is a 501(c)(3) organization formed so that members of the atheist
community can become involved in community service, education and public
outreach, and promoting the principle of separation of church and state.



If you are an atheist in the Houston area, we invite you to join us!

We're 2,957 Atheists
