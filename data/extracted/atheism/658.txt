Celebrity Atheists List

Celebrity atheists include some of the biggest names in entertainment and pop
culture who do not believe in a higher power. This is a list of famous
atheists, with photos, that is regularly updated as new celebrities choose
atheism.

Who are the most famous celebrity atheists? There are hundreds of famous
Hollywood atheists from TV, film, radio, and the theater. Some notable atheists
on this list have either come out with or mentioned their atheism in public and
others are just known for a lack of a belief in God. Celebrity atheism seems to
be more prominent with the show-business set than in middle America. It's not
as big a deal today to say "There Is No God" and still make lots of money in
the entertainment industry as it used to be.
