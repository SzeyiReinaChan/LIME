Kenya bus attack: Al-Shabaab militants kill 28 non-Muslims who failed to recite
Koran

    Terror organisation al-Shabaab have claimed an attack that killed 28 people
    on a bus in Northern Kenya.

    Around 100 gunmen, who are believed to have travelled over the border in
    Mandera county from Somalia, took the bus off the road before separating
    the passengers.

    It is believed they asked travellers to recite passages from the Koran,
    shooting dead those who were unable to prove they were practising Muslims.

    A statement on a website linked to the extremist organisation said the
    attack was carried out in retaliation for security raids on mosques in the
    coastal city of Mombassa earlier this week.

    Kenya’s Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government
    claimed on their official account earlier today: “Attackers camp has been
    destroyed by KDF using helicopters and jets, many killed, operations
    continue.”

    The bus was travelling to the Kenyan capital Nairobi when it was stopped in
    the northern county that borders Somalia.

    Around 60 people were on the bus at the time of the attack, and it is
    thought that among the dead are Kenyan public servants – including four
    police officers – who were heading to the capital for the Christmas
    holiday.

    Mandera East deputy County Commissioner Elvis Korir said the passengers
    were then separated into two groups. The Somali passengers watched in
    horror as non-Somalis were herded away from the bus and then killed.

    Mr Korir added that many details over the attack remain unclear, but the
    deaths underscore fears over the lack of security, especially in the remote
    parts of northern Kenya.

    Abdullahi Abdirahman, the Arabiya Ward Representative, told the Daily
    Nation: “This place has been prone to attacks, this is not the first time
    the government has totally ignored us, and you can now see the how many
    innocent precious lives have been lost”.

    In early November, gunmen killed 20 police officers and two police
    reservists in an ambush in Turkana county in the northwest of Kenya.

    The northern region of Kenya is awash with guns due to its proximity with
    Somalia and Ethiopia, from where the armed Oromo Liberation Front has made
    incursions into Kenya.

    Since 2011 the Somalia-based terror group al-Shabaab, which is linked to
    al-Qaeda, have carried out a series of attacks in Kenya, including the
    Westgate Mall attack in which 67 people were killed.

“I’m an Atheist” – Stephen Hawking

    World-famous theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking says flat-out that he
    doesn’t believe in God, but he does believe that space travel offers the
    best hope for our species’ immortality.

    Those pronouncements came during the buildup to this week’s Starmus
    Festival at Tenerife in the Canary Islands, where Hawking and other
    scientific luminaries have gathered for rounds of talks, tours and
    elbow-rubbing.

    The Spanish newspaper El Mundo engineered an exclusive interview with
    Hawking, and headlined its report with his views on the origins of the
    universe.

    In the past, there’s been a tiny bit of ambiguity: In “A Brief History of
    Time,” Hawking writes that the discovery of a unifying set of scientific
    principles known as the theory of everything would enable scientists to
    “know the mind of God.” But in a follow-up book about the quest for the
    theory of everything, titled “The Grand Design,” Hawking said the mechanism
    behind the origin of the universe was becoming so well known that God was
    no longer necessary.

    El Mundo’s Pablo Jauregui asked about those two references to God in one of
    the questions he prepared for Hawking to answer, and here’s the scientist’s
    response:

        “Before we understand science, it is natural to believe that God
        created the universe. But now science offers a more convincing
        explanation. What I meant by ‘we would know the mind of God’ is, we
        would know everything that God would know, if there were a God, which
        there isn’t. I’m an atheist.”

    Hawking addressed the issue more delicately several years ago when he told
    Reuters that he was “not religious in the normal sense,” and said “God does
    not intervene to break the laws” that He decreed. Since then, however,
    there’s been a lot more theorizing devoted to the origin of the universe.
    Hawking now believes that an approach known as M-theory will eventually
    reveal the grand design of the cosmos.

    “In my opinion, there is no aspect of reality beyond the reach of the human
    mind,” Hawking told El Mundo.

The Air Force will now allow airmen to omit ‘so help me God’ from enlistment
oaths

the-air-force-will-now-allow-airmen-to-omit-so-help-me-god-from-enlistment-oaths
/

     After an airman was unable to complete his reenlistment because he omitted
    the part of a required oath that states “so help me God,” the Air Force
    changed its instructions for the oath.

    Following a review of the policy by the Department of Defense General
    Counsel, the Air Force will now permit airmen to omit the phrase, should
    they so choose. That change is effective immediately, according to an Air
    Force statement.

    “We take any instance in which Airmen report concerns regarding religious
    freedom seriously,” Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James said in
    the statement. “We are making the appropriate adjustments to ensure our
    Airmen’s rights are protected.

    “The Air Force will be updating the instructions for both enlisted and
    commissioned Airmen to reflect these changes in the coming weeks, but the
    policy change is effective now. Airmen who choose to omit the words ‘So
    help me God’ from enlistment and officer appointment oaths may do so.”

    The issue gained national attention in early September after a letter from
    the American Humanist Association outlined the case of an airman stationed
    at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada who was unable to complete his
    reenlistment after striking out the phrase in question on a form. The AHA
    said it was prepared to sue on religious freedom grounds unless the airman
    was allowed to reenlist without saying the phrase. The requirement, the AHA
    argued, violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution.

    The issue drew attention to a previously unnoticed rule change: The rules
    governing the Air Force’s enlistment oaths used to include a note stating
    that “Airmen may omit the words ‘so help me God,’ if desired for personal
    reasons.” That exception quietly disappeared in October 2013, after which
    the Air Force required the inclusion of the full oath for any enlistment or
    reenlistment.

    Now, the airman’s paperwork “will be processed to completion,” the Air
    Force statement said.

    “We are pleased that the U.S. Department of Defense has confirmed our
    client has a First Amendment right to omit the reference to a supreme being
    in his reenlistment oath,” Monica Miller, an attorney with the American
    Humanist Association’s Appignani Humanist Legal Center, said in an emailed
    statement.

Irony lost on ISIS, as they ban math, social studies for children

    In swaths of Syria now controlled by ISIS, children can no longer study
    math or social studies. Sports are out of the question. And students will
    be banned from learning about elections and democracy.

    Instead, they’ll be subjected to the teachings of the radical Islamist
    group. And any teacher who dares to break the rules “will be punished.”
    ISIS revealed its new educational demands in fliers posted on billboards
    and on street poles.

    The Sunni militant group has captured a slew of Syrian and Iraqi cities in
    recent months as it tries to establish a caliphate, or Islamic state,
    spanning Sunni parts of both countries.

    In the letter, ISIS said alternative courses will be added.

    It also said teachers must erase the phrase Syrian Arab Republic — the
    official name of Syria — and replace it with Islamic State, which is what
    ISIS calls itself.

    Educators cannot teach nationalistic and ethnic ideology and must instead
    teach “the belonging to Islam … and to denounce infidelity and infidels.”

    Books cannot include any reference to evolution. And teachers must say that
    the laws of physics and chemistry “are due to Allah’s rules and laws.”

    The letter ends with a firm warning:
    “This is an obligatory announcement, and all violators will be punished.”

    200 Syrians killed in one day

    The brutal advances of ISIS in Syria come as the country grapples with a
    three-year civil war with no clear victor in sight.

    At least 200 people were killed on Tuesday alone, the opposition group
    Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. It said about 60 were killed by
    regime airstrikes.

    The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency, meanwhile, said terrorist attacks in
    Damascus, Hama and Homs left at least three civilians dead.

    In all, the United Nations estimates more than 190,000 people have died in
    the violence between President Bashar al-Assad’s regime and rebels seeking
    an end to four decades of al-Assad family rule.
