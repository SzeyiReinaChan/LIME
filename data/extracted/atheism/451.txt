The Idaho Society of Reason (ISR) encourages rationale and logic over
superstition.

By definition, reason requires the power of comprehending, inferring, or
thinking - especially in orderly rational ways.  Reasoning is the power of the
mind to think, understand and form judgments logically.  By definition, it
infers a lack of superstition.

According to Britannica, superstition is defined as the belief, half-belief, or
practice for which there appears to be no rational substance.  Superstitions
may be classified roughly as religious, cultural, and personal.  Every
religious system tends to accumulate superstitions as peripheral beliefs - a
Christian, for example, may believe that in time of trouble he will be guided
by the Bible if he opens it at random and reads the text that first strikes his
eye.  Often, one person's religion is another one's superstition:  The Roman
emperor Constantine referred to non-Christian practices as superstition; the
Roman historian Tacitus called Christianity a pernicious superstition; Roman
Catholic veneration of relics, images and the saints is dismissed as
superstitious by many Protestants; Christians regard many Hindu practices as
superstitious; and adherents of all "higher" religions may consider the
Australian Aborigine's relation to his totem superstitious.  Finally, all
religious beliefs and practices amount to nothing more than superstition to a
person without superstitious beliefs.
