Apologetics Exposed

Christian Apologists, for various individual reasons, take advantage of
Christians by telling them what they want to hear instead of what is actually
true. It is understandably hard believe they would deliberately lie but ask
yourself, if history and science supported the claims of Apologists why would
Apologists exist? Why would we turn to someone other than historians or
scientists, the experts in their related fields of research, for answers
related to history or science?

Below are some examples to demonstrate that Apologists do in fact make
blatantly dishonest claims.

  • Chick Tract: Are You A Good Person?

    dishonest attempts to guilt you into following them.

  • Quote Mining

    experts agree with them. Take a look at a common example.

  • What They Say, But Not What They Mean

    Being honest about the words said by scientists while lying about what was
    actually meant by those words is a common tactic by Apologists.

  • US, a Christian Nation?

    but that simply is not true according to our Founding Fathers.

  • Hitler, atheist or Christian?

    As a cheap attempt to scare people into believing in God, apologists claim

    Christian.
