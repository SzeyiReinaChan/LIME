Curious about Secular Humanism?


If you’ve rejected traditional religion (or were never religious to start), you
may be asking, “Is that all there is?” It’s liberating to recognize that
supernatural beings are human creations … that there are no such things as
“spirit” or “transcendence”... that people are undesigned, unintended, and
responsible for themselves.

But what’s next?

For many, mere atheism (the absence of belief in gods and the supernatural) or
agnosticism (the view that such questions cannot be answered) aren’t enough.

Atheism and agnosticism are silent on larger questions of values and meaning.
If Meaning in life is not ordained from on high, what small-m meanings can we
work out among ourselves? If eternal life is an illusion, how can we make the
most of our only lives? As social beings sharing a godless world, how should we
coexist?

For the questions that remain unanswered after we’ve cleared our minds of gods
and souls and spirits, many atheists, agnostics, skeptics, and freethinkers
turn to secular humanism.
