Secular Student Association

President: Kyle Kraemer
Advisor: Dr. Christopher Ciocchetti

What We Are About
Centenary's Secular Student Association is an organization that sponsors public
dialogue on secular/religious issues on campus and advocates for the acceptance
of atheists, agnostics, humanists, freethinkers, and other secular people. We
hold monthly discussion meetings in James Lobby and conduct outreach programs
for our cause. All Centenary students and faculty are welcome to join us
regardless of their opinions and creed, and we specifically endorse
collaboration between secular and religious organizations to achieve a common
level of academic and civil understanding.
