Welcome to Rhode Island Atheist Society. We are a growing group of atheists,
agnostics, humanists, and freethinkers who believe in promoting a positive view
of godlessness while building a strong community that we can call our own. We
support the separation of church and state and work hard to ensure the wall
between them stays strong. Religious groups have a tremendous amount of power
and influence in politics and government. We are the advocate for the
non-believers of this state.


Rhode Island Atheist Society is a 501c3 Non Profit Organization

We have also formed an official organization the "Rhode Island Atheist
Society". http://riatheist.com/ and podcast http://www.freethoughtri.com

Whether you want to be a strong activist or simply come and chat, please join
our group.
