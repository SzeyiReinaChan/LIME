Chick Dissection | Somebody Loves Me

Posted on July 20, 2009 by admin

    Beaten and alone, a child dies. But Jesus cares.

He doesn’t care enough to keep the kid from getting beaten to death, I guess.
Hell, I’d stop a kid from getting beaten to death, and I’m just a regular ol’
human.

A particularly depressing, ugly turd of a Tract. Way to go, Jack!

Chick Dissection | The Thing

Posted on May 13, 2009 by admin

    The thing possessed poor Maria. It drove her to do strange things. But
    Jesus’ power delivered her so the thing couldn’t hurt her anymore.

I want to read this as a euphemism, and considering how religious and
superstitious folk have treated everything from mental disorders to
menstruation over the course of human history, I probably wouldn’t be too far
off the mark: “The thing” possessed poor Maria, and made her do strange things!
(Psst — “the thing” is her menses! Oogabooga!)

Anyway, here’s another terrible Tract for you, hand-crafted by Jack Chick with
all the talent, love and beauty of a cat throwing up half a dead mouse onto
your bed. Enjoy!

Putting the ‘Fun’ in ‘Fundamentalism’

Posted on May 4, 2009 by admin
38

So, who here has interesting or entertaining stories about dealing with
religious kooks of one variety or another? Did your parents join a cult? Have
you gotten into a heated and serious argument with a fundamentalist only to
find out to your embarrassment that they were actually schizophrenic? Were you
ever forced to go to one of those “Gay Cure” camps? Did your religious friends
put a bucket of holy water above the door and keep a priest or pastor handy so
that they could baptize you when you walked in? Ever find a Chick Tract rolled
up inside a condom? Any Catholics out there ever need the Heimlich because you
choked on the communion wafer?

Well, I want to hear about it.

The best, most amusing (and most believable — and trust me, I’ll probably be
able to smell bullshit when I read it) stories will be featured as posts (with
all due credit, of course, plus a link to your website if you have one or a
sketch of your favorite pony or whatever you want to accompany it). And, as
with FMyLife and other such sites, don’t be offended if your story doesn’t make
the cut.

For right now, e-mail them to me using the “Contact” page over on the left (or
if you have an account on the site, log in and submit them as posts) — I’ll try
to have some kind of form up by the end of the week.

Tell your friends. Seriously this time. I know some of you actually are, and I
really appreciate it, but you other guys… it takes thirty seconds. Only
slightly more time than it takes to *cough ahem* click an ad on the side of the
page and then close the browser window *choke cough ahem*.

Speaking of telling your friends, only TWO MORE DAYS to the END OF MAY 5TH, the
HOG CALL DEADLINE. I’m still 249,879 Twitter followers away from my goal! Let’s
get on this shit!

Chick Dissection | The Little Lamb (Guest Dissection by Adude)

Posted on April 4, 2009 by Adude

    “The Passover lamb saved the lives of the firstborn Jews in Egypt. Now
    Jesus is the Lamb who can save you!”

Ah, Exodus. One of the most famous books in the Old Testament, and my favorite
for all the wrong reasons. This… this will be fun.

J: It’s my favorite for even wronger reasons. *breaks out the Kleenex and
Vaseline* Let’s do this!

J: (Again, my stuff will be denoted as you see here, with the J:, and anything
unmarked belongs to the guest Dissector. This one wasn’t a tag-team-style one
like the last few — I just added my two cents afterward.)

Chick Dissection | First Bite

Posted on October 28, 2008 by admin

    Funny, campy, over-the-top. This Halloween tract by Jack Chick starts with
    a vampire story, but ends with a straight gospel message.

Storot:Yeah, “campy”…concentration campy.

nepphi: I don’t know, I think less ‘intense, soulless horror’ and more ‘awkward
teenage years’ when I read this one, so maybe…bible campy?

Storot: I was just looking for a pun on the sheer awfulness of the tract. Or
Jack’s Jewy arch-villains.

J: You know, isn’t Jack kind of disobeying his own moral guidelines, here, by
telling a vampire story? If other forms of fantasy are all evil and will lead
people to demonic possession, does it really matter if they tack a gospel
message onto the end of it? By this logic, if D&D guidebooks included some
random passage from Mark at the end of it, would Jack retract Dark Dungeons?

Storot: When reading the following tract, enhance your experience with an audio
track. We at Consolidated Incorporated (our slogan “If you need it, talk to
someone else. We can’t help you”) recommend “Fingernails on a Chalkboard”,
“Cats In Heat”, or “Rosanne Barr’s Rendition of ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’”.
Anything to distract you from the pain before you.

Chick Dissection | Moving On Up

Posted on May 19, 2008 by admin
101

Well we’re movin on up,
To the shoreside.
To a deluxe apartment on the sand.
Movin on up,
To the shoreside.
We’re finally gonna walk on the land.

Another one about evolution, this time really stretching every far-fetched,
contrived argument well beyond any point of credibility. If I ever discover
there was a single person in the world who was convinced by any of the
ludicrous arguments put forth in this Tract, I… well… I’m not sure what I’ll
do. I think I’ll spend the rest of my life crying.

He’s really outdone himself this time. This one… it’s… it’s just the worst.

The art isn’t terrible, but the message certainly is. This is going to be a
ranty/lengthy Dissection, but hey — I haven’t done one in a while.

Chick Dissection | Dark Dungeons Revisited (Epic Tag-Team Gary Gygax Died For
Your Sins Edition)

Posted on April 2, 2008 by ascendance
66

I’ve been meaning to revisit some of the earlier Dissections, since I did them
long before I got much of a feel for them, and it seems like there are a few
things missing from them. So in light of Gary Gygax’s recent demise, I figured
we’d pay a kind of tribute by going back and taking a look at the subject of
the very first Dissection: Dark Dungeons.

[nepphie] That’s us, honoring the creator of one of the greatest games ever by
re-trashing a tract that completely misrepresents said game.

Since nepphie has done all the work of tagging all of his lines with [nepphie],
we’re going to ditch the usual convention. My lines will be the unprefixed
ones.

Chick Dissection | Titanic (Guest Dissection by DaAlCh)

    Chester thought he didn’t need God. But when the ship began to sink, he
    learned how wrong he was.

No he doesn’t. Chester never realizes that he needed God until after he
croaked. False advertising, Jack.

J: Jack Chick? Bending the truth? Never!

J: You can probably already tell from the title, but this week is a Guest
Dissection submitted by reader DaAICh. As always, my text blocks will be
prefaced with J:.

Chick Dissection | Apes, Lies and Ms. Henn

Posted on January 4, 2008 by admin

    School children are taught that we don’t need God, because we are just
    animals who came from apes. But Susy tells her young friend that God made
    us, and sent his Son to give us eternal life. A children’s tract.

Wow, Jack, way to read way the fuck too much into the implications of
evolution. I fail to see how evolution is in any way incompatible with the
existence of God, or how our being mammalian somehow means we’re “just
animals”. It’s kind of amazing that I, as a secular person, seem to be giving
God far, far more credit than fundamentalist Christians seem to. I dunno, I
think an omnipotent being would be fully capable of fashioning a creation that
could change and advance and develop on its own without constant intervention.

“A children’s tract.” Hooray! Brainwash your kids in such a way that it’s
effectively an information virus that prevents their minds from even processing
any new information! Awesome! No need for knowledge, or the ability to analyze
the observable world — all you need is faith! Fuck you, Jack. No, seriously.
I’ve said it before, but I really mean it this time.

Chick Dissection | Party Girl (Tag-Team Guest Dissection with Ascendance)

    A young woman’s brush with death reveals Satan’s plot for her destruction.

We’re trying something a little different this week, using Google docs to
simultaneously work on a Dissection for a more back and forth commentary. So,
without any further delay than there has already been for this one, here’s…
