Ian Stevenson (1918-2007)

ian stevensonIan Stevenson was a psychiatrist who gave up scientific medicine
to collect past-life experience stories (PLEs) that he thought provided
evidence for reincarnation. He graduated at the top of his class with a medical
degree from McGill University (Montreal) in 1943. He also did advanced work in
psychoanalysis, though he came to reject Freudian psychology. He preferred the
concepts of the unconscious minddeveloped by the likes of William James, Carl
Jung, and Frederic Myers, which "allowed for unconscious mental processes to be
the sources or the conduits of man's higher creative achievements (as well as
some of his pathological aberrations); they allowed also for the experiences we
call paranormal and even for a soul" (Stevenson 1989). One thing he agreed with
the Freudians on was their "awareness of the importance of mental processes in
human disease. This element is minimized or openly denied by most investigators
in psychology, genetics, and neurobiology. For them mind is a byproduct of
cerebral processes and free will an illusion" (Stevenson 1989). Stevenson's
recurring self-portrait was that of a maverick bucking the mainstream.>>more

Mozart effect

In a nutshell: The Mozart effect is a boost in intelligence that comes from
listening to Mozart. The science doesn't support the boost, though listening to
Mozart hasn't harmed anybody as far as we know.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) was one of the world's greatest composers
of classical music. He began writing music and performing on the keyboard and
violin when he was five years old. He wrote over 600 musical pieces. For many
people, one of the great joys in life is listening to Mozart's music in concert
halls or on an iPod. But the wonderful feeling that comes from listening to
Mozart isn't what is meant by the Mozart effect.>>more

Book Review: The Afterlife Experiments by  Gary Schwartz           

How not to conduct scientific research

Schwartz subtitles his book “Breakthrough Scientific Evidence of Life After
Death.” Yet, the book is a hodgepodge of variously designed studies and
anecdotes. What he seems to demand of the reader is that we take the sum total
of all his work (and the work of others) as the scientific evidence for the
existence of life after death. He knows anecdotes aren’t scientific evidence.
And he knows that inadequately designed or inadequately controlled experiments
aren’t good scientific evidence. Thus, even though he doesn’t have a single
study in his book that provides such clear scientific evidence for the
afterlife that only the most hardened skeptic could doubt it, Schwartz still
maintains that overall the evidence is overwhelmingly in favor of his
hypothesis. So, what’s the evidence?>>more
