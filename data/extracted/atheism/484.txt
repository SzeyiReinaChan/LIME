The Boston Ethical Community is a non-theistic humanistic religious and
educational fellowship inspired by the ideal that the supreme aim of human life
is working to create a more humane society. Together we develop our ethical
ideals, celebrate life's joys, and support one another through life's crises.
We work for the improvement of our world and for the future of our children.
Membership is open to those who agree with our principles regardless of race,
religion, or national origin.

As ethical humanists, we believe it is important to understand the complexity
of modern life. We live in a changing society and we want to help it change in
a way that is helpful to humanity. Like traditional religious groups, our
values are important in our lives and social actions, but they are not limited
by dogma or tradition.

The Boston Ethical Community is part of the larger Ethical Culture movement
whose member societies are joined together through the American Ethical Union,
headquartered in New York, NY, which has about two dozen societies in the U.S.
The AEU belongs to the International Humanist and Ethical Union with branches
in about 100 countries worldwide.

We hold Sunday Platform Meetings at the Longy School of Music Rey-Waldstein
Building, Room N1, Cambridge, Massachusetts each Sunday from 10:30 A.M. to
12:30 P.M. on a more or less academic calendar. Meetings are free and open to
the public. Platforms include a featured guest speaker and discussion,
readings, and music. We cover a wide range of social, political, environmental,
emotional, and interpersonal issues - including matters of war, peace, and
justice.

We also give a series of short courses called the School for Ethics that
explore ethics in society, in personal relationships and in the arts. We
present an annual Humanist of the Year Award each Spring.

We also have a range of social events, including potluck suppers, nature walks,
book discussions, and a movie group.
