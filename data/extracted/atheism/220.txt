Ape, not monkey goes to TAM! 2013

July 11th, 2013
Tweet

[JREF13postcard2_PRINT]This will be the first time I’m attending The Amaz!ng
Meeting, an annual gathering for Critical Thinkers in Las Vegas.

I’ll also be speaking about this comic strip as part of the Sunday Papers
series.  (Sunday July 14th @ 8am).

If you see a bald guy with thick black rimmed glasses, it’s probably me. You
can also follow me on twitter: @apenotmonkey.
