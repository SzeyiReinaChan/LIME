Atheists United SLO is a meeting place for all atheists, humanists,
rationalists, skeptics, doubters, agnostics, and other non-believers to get to
know each other, share ideas and build a community of like minded individuals
in San Luis Obispo County.

Atheists United SLO is an active, exciting community of people who come
together to:

  • encourage critical thinking about religion,
  • advocate for the separation of church and state in our community, and
  • educate the community about the positive aspects of atheism.

Our activities include:

  • social get-togethers where atheists and those questioning their beliefs can
    talk about anything in a casual, friendly atmosphere
  • joint activities with the Cal Poly Alliance of Happy Atheists
  • pizza and DVD night
  • book discussions
  • political and social advocacy and more.

We are seeking active members spanning the generations to establish a busy
chapter with dynamic and informative meetings that will cause debate and
provoke thought. All input is valuable in creating a viable and visible atheist
community.

Invite a Friend! Bring a Believer! But, please do not hesitate to join us!

For questions regarding this group, please contact the Assistant Organizer
directly.

Atheists United SLO is a chapter of Atheists United, which provided the funding
for this Meet Up site. Paid membership to our parent group is encouraged but
not required to attend and participate in our meetings however there are many
more activities that take place around Southern California put on by Atheists
United as well as an informative monthly newsletter that you can benefit from
and enjoy if you are a member. Please visit that website to review Atheists
United's mission and consider joining if you agree with its aims.
