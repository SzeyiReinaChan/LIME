                                    I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in
                                    one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you
                                    dismiss all the other possible gods, you will
                                    understand why I dismiss yours.
                                      - Stephen Roberts
                                     
                                      ALL GODS ARE MAKE-BELIEVE, however as per Arthur
                                    Schopenhauer ...  "All truth passes through three
                                    stages:  First it is ridiculed.  Second it is violently
                                    opposed.  Third, it is accepted as being self-evident."
                                     

                                      EVERYTHING SAID IN THE CONTEXT OF GOD BEING REAL IS
                                                        MERE NONSENSE.
