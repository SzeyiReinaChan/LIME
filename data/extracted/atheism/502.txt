We Believe In You!

 
[]

    The Missoula Area Secular Society (M.A.S.S.) is a 501(c)3 Non-Profit
    Organization, established in July 2008, located in Missoula, MT.

    Our mission is (a) to foster a community of non-theistic individuals by
    providing opportunities for socializing, networking, and friendship, and
    (b) to develop and/or promote programs focusing on secular ethics, science,
    history, and critical thinking for members, their children, and the public
    at large as alternatives to the supernatural interpretations of the human
    condition.


    We are atheists, secular humanists, agnostics, skeptics, and other Missoula
    citizens unencumbered by superstition. We are your neighbors, your
    co-workers, your friends, your fellow Americans.


    There are a number of ways to get involved with our organization.  To find
    local events visit our meet-up pages.  We have a site for official M.A.S.S.
    events as well as an additional site for events put on by our members from
    the local community.
