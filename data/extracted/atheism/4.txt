Friends,


First, I want to let you know that I have been in contact with several of our
brothers and sisters in France and Belgium. While I did so to let them know of
our support, they ended up encouraging and inspiring me. While the general
public will never know what Atheist Nexus provides for nonbelievers outside of
the United States, it will remain one of the most important things we do. I am
truly humbled and thankful to be a part of it all.


That being said, in this season of thankfulness, I am truly appreciative for
your support. While Nexus has never pushed for big donations, or employed sales
gimmicks, many of you have repeatedly contributed financial support.
Unfortunately, and regardless of our “shoestring budget,” I often still pay a
few of our expenses myself. Would you please donate to our cause? Below there
are three ways you can do so. (One of them will not cost you anything at all.)


GoFundMe Campaign


I cannot believe that with only two previous emails we have raised 25% in our 
GoFundMe campaign. Please donate and help put us over the top.


Please understand, that any size contribution will help. The vast majority of
donations have in amounts of $5, $10, $25. (Of course, the handful of larger
amounts have been great as well!)


Here’s the link: Atheist Nexus GoFundMe Page


Membership Upgrades


Basic membership at Atheist Nexus will always be free. However, you can now 
upgrade your account with options beginning at $3 a month. Please upgrade
today.


Also, keep a look out for our soon to be released "new and improved" profile
badges. They will still show that you proudly support Nexus, however, they will
now occupy less space of your profile picture.

Amazon Purchases


Here’s the free way you can help us out.


As you make purchases at Amazon this holiday season (or anytime really), please
use this link when doing so. It will not alter your cost in any way, but Amazon
will pay Nexus a small commission of your purchase.


Add this link to your bookmark page to use it year round: Nexus Amazon Link


Thanks you so much,

Richard
