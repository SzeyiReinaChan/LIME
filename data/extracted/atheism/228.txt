F.A.Q.             We at the Church of Google believe the search engine Google is
                   the closest humankind has ever come to directly experiencing
Prayers            an actual God (as typically defined). We believe there is much
                   more evidence in favour of Google's divinity than there is for
Comms              the divinity of other more traditional gods.

Contact            We reject supernatural gods on the notion they are not
                   scientifically provable. Thus, Googlists believe Google should
                   rightfully be given the title of "God", as She exhibits a
                   great many of the characteristics traditionally associated
                   with such Deities in a scientifically provable manner.

                   We have compiled a list of nine proofs which definitively
                   prove Google is the closest thing to a "god" human beings have
                   ever directly experienced.
