                           Inside the cult, L. Ron Hubbard is attributed with a
                           fantastic past and incredible insight. However, most
                           of these claims originate from L. Ron Hubbard and
                           are only verified by L. Ron Hubbard himself. This is
                           a closer look at his claims of being a war hero.
