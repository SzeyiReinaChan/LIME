mna family place razooForgo the army of bell-ringers, red kettles, and
faith-based charities which are too concerned with misguided bible-based morals
and ideas of salvation. Consider, instead, making a financial donation to
Minnesota Atheists and/or Foundation Beyond Belief who acknowledges that
there's no supernatural power to make this world a better place. They know that
it's up to humanity, iteself, to improve this world and this life.

Minnesota Atheists has benefitted from the efforts of Foundation Beyond Belief
(FBB) and their 100+ affiliates by helping bolster our volunteer service
projects at a local homeless shelter, food bank, hospital, and more. Because of
their ongoing support and incredible work they do locally, nationally, and
globally, Minnesota Atheists set up a Razoo account for an end of the year
charitable fundraiser to help support FBB so they can carry out their mission: 
To demonstrate humanism at its best by supporting efforts to improve this world
and this life, and to challenge humanists to embody the highest principles of
humanism, including mutual care and responsibility.

mna happy holidays tagSnow is on the ground, eggnog is readily available,
twinkling lights are brightening up the cold winter night, and conservative
Christians are complaining about the holiday decorations at coffee shops and
other retailers. All of this signals that the annual "War on Christmas" is upon
us! To celebrate the War on Christmas, some local atheists and other
freethinkers will be joining up for some fun, secular, holiday cheer at the
banquet room inside the Green Mill Restaurant in St. Paul just as we've done
for the past five years.

groupLocal baseball fans gave up their soles to atheists this past Saturday at
CHS Field in downtown St. Paul. The fourth annual atheist-themed St. Paul
Saints game integrated a shoe drive this year which was advertised as “Leave
Your Soles at the Gate” and it was sponsored by Minnesota Atheists, Foundation
Beyond Belief, and Humanists of Minnesota. The 400 pairs of shoes we collected
benefits Soles4Souls whose mission is to fight poverty through the collection
and distribution of shoes and clothes. Not only was this collaborative
achievement a lot of fun, but it also embodies the natural compassion of people
whether they are religiously faithful, atheist, or somewhere in between.

soles at the gateThe Minnesota Twins will be holding their first ever “Faith
Night” at Target Field on Aug. 29. That’s exactly three weeks after the minor
league St. Paul Saints hold “Atheist Night” at CHS Field. I’m certain that both
games will be fun but since I’m from the expanding group of religiously
unaffiliated (aka “nones”) I am most excited about the unbelievable brand of
fun with the St. Paul Saints this Saturday. They are the only professional
sports team in the country to hold such an event, but I’ve been wondering if
the Twins and other sports teams will someday take advantage of the
opportunities received by appealing to their own nonbelieving fans.

August Berkshire wrote and read this tribute at the memorial for Robert
Nienkerk on June 29, 2015.

nienkerkNature just provided us with a brief rainstorm, so we would all have
something that Bob would have appreciated: nice clean cars!

In early 1984, Madalyn Murray O’Hair and Jon Murray came to the Twin Cities, on
their second or third attempt to try to form a chapter of American Atheists
here. This time it worked, and a bunch of us, including Bob & Marilyn Nienkerk,
started the Twin Cities Chapter of American Atheists, which became Minnesota
Atheists seven years later.
