If you accept the natural over the supernatural, reality over mythology, and
evidence over faith, then you're in the right place. Please join this group of
like-minded folks to discuss these and other relevant ideas. We welcome anyone
from Atheists to Agnostics, Free-Thinkers, Humanists and Skeptics. Anyone with
a rational worldview is encouraged to join and attend our meetups.
