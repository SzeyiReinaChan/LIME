Life beyond belief: 30 minutes on "Heaven"

BBC Radio 4's Beyond Belief recently covered "Heaven and the Afterlife":

    The question of what happens after we die is central to the world's faith
    traditions. How has the belief in an afterlife developed across the
    religions? And what does Heaven mean to people of faith today?

    Ernie Rea discusses the concept of the afterlife with Shaunaka Rishi Das,
    Director of the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies; Dr Shuruq Naguib, lecturer
    in Islamic Studies at Lancaster University; and the writer and broadcaster 
    Peter Stanford.
    Producer: Amanda Hancox

[beyond_bel]Ernie Rae's studio guests asserted a great deal about stuff they
couldn't possibly know, and as usual with this half-hour programme and several
guests, nothing could be considered very deeply. Just enough time for someone
to state that "studies have shown" that people who have a belief in an
afterlife face death more peacefully than those who don't, plus the assumption
that of course someone who believes in an afterlife will act more morally in
their life before death.

There was also an inserted interview with resuscitation researcher Dr Sam
Parnia who claimed that the scientific consensus was that the soul is something
apart from the brain.

All far too superficial and unsatisfactory — I wonder why they bothered.

Complexity, inevitability, and life — Evolution 2.0 on Unbelievable?

[Perry-Marshall-PZ-Myers-Main_article_image]
Listening to the latest Unbelievable? show from Premier Radio I was struck by
what appeared to be a failure of imagination on the part of Perry Marshall, who
was debating evolutionary biologist PZ Myers about the former's recent book,
Evolution 2.0. Not being a biologist of any kind I'm unable to comment
authoritatively on the actual mechanisms of evolution, but having followed PZ
Myers' blog Pharyngula in the past (less so these days) I'm fairly confident he
knows what he's talking about when it comes to his own subject. Perry
Marshall's background, however, is in engineering and marketing, which on the
face of it should make me wary of pronouncements that are outside his field of
expertise.

Myers rubbished pretty much everything Marshall proposed, and given the above
I'm prepared to accept that Myers is right and Marshall is wrong. The debate
was fairly technical, but seemed to me to boil down to Marshall's claim that
the “random” part of random mutation is insufficient to explain how evolution
works (notwithstanding other aspects of evolution such as horizontal gene
transfer).

At one point Marshall stated that the code in DNA could fit on a Compact Disc,
and that if you eliminated “junk DNA” the code would be merely ten percent of
what could fit on a CD. The core of his argument appeared to be disbelief that
such a relatively small amount of information could produce the complexity we
see in living organisms today. By comparison he cited the amount of code
required to install modern computer operating systems such as Windows 10 and
Mac OS X.

Marshall's engineering background has hampered his thinking here. Engineers who
design systems, be they engines, bridges, or computer operating systems, need
to specify mechanisms in minute detail (or make use of minutely detailed
specifications already available) in order to make their systems work. This
notion of "engineering ex nihilo" is what in my opinion leads to the essential
failure-of-imagination exhibited by intelligent design proponents and
creationists (of whom a disproportionately large number are engineers) — “it's
all so complicated it must have been minutely designed by an intelligence of
some kind.”

But imagine a software programmer who has never encountered fractals is shown a
picture of the Mandelbrot set, and is given the task of writing code to
generate the same picture from scratch. Without knowledge of the simple
equation that produces fractals the picture could indeed be generated, but I
suspect the code would be somewhat large. Or imagine a manufacturer of
breakfast cereal wants its packaging department to come up with a special
gadget to ensure that each carton of cornflakes contains a gradation of flakes,
such that the larger flakes are mostly towards the top of the carton and the
smaller ones mostly towards the bottom. I'm sure such a gadget could be made,
but it's not actually necessary as the cornflakes tend to sort themselves out
this way on their own.

Such self-organisation is, in my view, an aspect of the discussion about
complexity that is often overlooked. If things inevitably organise themselves
in a particular way, trying to make them happen in other ways, against the
natural order, will indeed require complex intervention. “Going with the flow”
on the other hand, will often require no intervention at all. It seems to me
that much of the complexity we see in nature is there because in a given
environment, things tend to work out that way rather than any other, just like
in a packet of cornflakes.

[Mandelbrot_Set-4-SEAHORSE_ZOOM]
A small part of the Mandelbrot set
This is applicable in other systems too, such as how you organise your life.
For instance, it makes sense to keep things you need regularly in designated
places, so that you don't have to embark on a time-consuming search every time
you need them. If you need to take something with you when you go out, you
could set an alarm on your smartphone to remind you to pick it up at the
appropriate time — or you could simply place the item where you will see it
when you do go out.

To put this another way: don't expend energy trying to achieve things in spite
of your environment. Rather, create, encourage and adjust your environment such
that it allows those things to be achieved automatically. (There you go — who'd
have thought a debate on evolution would lead to productivity advice and
life-coaching?)

UPDATE 2016-01-04: Perry Marshall has published online his transcript of the
debate, along with some restrospective comments:
http://cosmicfingerprints.com/pz-myers/
...And here's PZ Myers' response to the comments:
http://freethoughtblogs.com/pharyngula/2016/01/03/perry-marshall-2-0/

UPDATE 2016-01-10: Looks like this will run and run. Perry Marshall has
responded to PZ Myers' response to his comments on his transcript:
http://cosmicfingerprints.com/pz-mcclintock/

UPDATE 2016-01-12: ...and PZ Myers further responds here:

God's gonna buy you a private jet

(From the Friendly Atheist via Marina on Facebook)

After listening to two pastors "explaining" why they all need private jets
(it's so that they can talk to God without being interrupted), Hemant Mehta has
a suggestion:

    Here’s an idea: If you’re so famous that you can’t fly everywhere without
    people stopping you, wear a disguise. Or fly First Class if you must. Or
    don’t stand up to talk to God like a crazy person when I’m sure God can
    read your mind just fine even if you’re seated and silent.

Here's the clip he was listening to:

These guys are either (this is my opinion) lying through their teeth, or they
are seriously delusional.

The whole business puts me in mind of this:

To a better life in 2016 and beyond

Marking the end of one year and the beginning of another, I offer this
uplifting sentiment: may life be better. Better than what? Better than it was,
whether it was bad, indifferent or even already pretty good.

[A]

As an original supporter of the Kickstarter campaign for Chris Johnson's book A
Better Life, I received an email yesterday offering a free download of the film
he has gone on to produce, based on the book, and also titled A Better Life. I
watched it last night and found it enjoyable, insightful and uplifting. Like
the book, it's beautifully produced and photographed, featuring many of the
people who were in the book.

    There is no God. Now what? If this is the only life we have, how does that
    affect how we live our lives, how we treat each other, and cope with death.
    As a follow-up to one of Kickstarter’s most successful publishing projects,
    photographer and filmmaker Chris Johnson introduces us to some of the many
    voices from his book. In this fascinating documentary — learn the stories
    behind the book in interviews with some of our greatest thinkers. Join
    Chris as he explores issues of joy & meaning and travels around the globe
    meeting people from all walks of life and backgrounds who challenge the
    false stereotypes of atheists as immoral and evil. From Daniel Dennett and
    A.C. Grayling, to Julia Sweeney and Robert Llewellyn — learn the various
    ways many atheists have left religion to a better life filled with love,
    compassion, hope, and wonder!



I got the movie for free, but you can buy it in the form of streaming video, HD
download, or DVD.

And you can still buy the original book:

Britain is no more a Christian nation than a White nation

[coel_lasilla_small]
Coel Hellier reflects on what the reaction would be if David Cameron had
described Britain as a "White country":

Britain is no more a Christian nation than a White nation | coelsblog

    If Britain is a Christian nation then it is also a White nation. The
    majority of the population is white and our history and cultural heritage
    are predominantly White. Nearly all of our institutions and our cultural
    traditions derive from people who were white.

Once again we have a demonstration of why secularism is the obvious way to go.

Wanna buy some 'E'? Sure you do!

No, not that 'E' — this is The Ecstasy of Wilko Johnson, a feature length
documentary film by Julien Temple, previously shown in BBC1's Imagine series,
and which until Christmas Eve 2015 was available to view on iPlayer.

Now you can buy it on DVD:
http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ecstasy-Wilko-Johnson-DVD-y/dp/B017DFEBEK/

[WilkoJohnsonEcstasy1500_]

Anyone who enjoyed the two-part BBC Radio 4 Mastertapes on Wilko Johnson will
absolutely want to see this extraordinary documentary shown on BBC1 in
November. Superlatives escape me — this is probably the best biographical
documentary film about a living artist I have ever seen. Truly brilliant,
uplifting, and surprising on so many levels.
