This book is about critical thinking and challenges the reader to ask:
What do I know and how do I know it?

When university graduate student David Stone publicly challenges Pastor, he
unknowingly threatens Pastor and Sister Leah s lifestyle of crime, corruption,
and debauchery. David is arrested for blasphemy and contends the State must
first prove the existence of God in court, using the standard Rules of
Evidence.
