Let's get together as like-minded people! This group is dedicated to the
promotion of critical thinking, science, consumer protection against
pseudoscientific claims, and anything else that falls under the "skeptical"
umbrella.

Any meetup ideas encouraged...

Please note: this is not a religious meetup, any person wishing to proselytize,
don't. Anyone who joins our group who uploads graphic or otherwise
objectionable pictures will be banned from the meetup. The arbiters of what
constitutes "graphic or objectionable" are the organizers.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact the organizer via email at:

golaun @ gmail dot com

remove all the spaces, put a period in place of the word "dot", and you should
have a usable email address.
