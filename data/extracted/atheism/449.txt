Humans have a natural desire to gather and develop relationships with one
another, but when you don't have a church, or even a religion, that can become
a large hurdle. Nobody should have to live as a recluse or feel like a social
outcast due to their beliefs (or lack thereof). We therefore invite all
Atheists, Agnostics, Freethinkers, Humanists, Brights, Naturalists, Skeptics,
members of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster, followers of the
Invisible Pink Unicorn, and anyone else who may be interested in joining our
growing local community of open-minded people for support, encouragement,
activities, intellectual conversation, and fellowship.

Anyone may join by clicking the button below. The membership dues are only $10/
year, with a 90-day free trial and no commitments. If you find it is not for
you, we will not hassle or bother you! This group is private mostly for the
benefit of new or curious members who may still be shy about their thoughts
about doubting or refuting religion, or being curious about a society of mostly
nontheists. We are not a reclusive group or a "secret" society.

You can also view our more public areas on:
