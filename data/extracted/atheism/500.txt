KANSAS CITY OASIS

CONNECT, INSPIRE, AND EMPOWER

An innovative community has formed right here in Kansas City. It’s called
Oasis.
And it’s where freethinkers have a safe place to learn, celebrate life, find
social support, and give back to the community.

Here, you’ll find a retreat—an oasis of sorts—for Agnostics, Humanists,
Skeptics, Atheists, Freethinkers, Deists, questioning Theists and the like.
You’ll find compassion and kindness, no matter where you are on your journey.
And you’ll find that you’ll no longer feel alone.

Come celebrate the human experience. Together, we can make a difference.

 

"Our species needs—and deserves—a citizenry with minds wide awake and a basic
understanding of how the world works."

—CARL SAGAN
The Demon-Haunted World
