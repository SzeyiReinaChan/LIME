Página de bienvenida en español

MAAF welcomes you. Nontheistic service members serve honorably throughout the
world -- always have; always will. However, nontheists are the last unprotected
minority. Humanists, atheists, agnostics, freethinkers, or other nontheists
have a home with MAAF. MAAF provides a unique service in building community for
atheists and humanists in the military. Whether you are a MAAFer or just
looking for information, we are here to help.
