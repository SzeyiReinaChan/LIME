                            An Assessment of Christian Authorities.
  Maintaining Deceptions
                            How do we know what Christianity teaches? Thousands of Christian
  Suppress Facts            Churches teach different things, and all Churches over two hundred
                            years old have changed their teachings during the last two
  Selecting Sources         centuries. One reason for disagreement is that different Churches
                            select different sources of authority. Among these sources are
  Fabricating Records       various writings, notably the Old Testament and the New Testament. 
                            Another source of authority is "traditions" especially "Apostolic
  Retrospective Prophesy    Traditions" supposedly passed down from the earliest years of
                            Christianity. Other sources include notable early Christian men -
  Ambiguous Authorities     the so-called Church Fathers.

  Ignore Injunctions        Over the centuries Christian Churches have also accorded supposedly
                            infallible authority to various men. For many centuries the Roman
  Invent, Amend and Discard (ie Byzantine) Emperors were held to be infallible - a fact that is
                            now heavily downplayed. Churches also taught that Councils of the
  Manipulate Language       whole Church, so called General Church Councils, were also
                            infallible. More recently the Roman Catholic Church has claimed
                            that Popes are also infallible. Each of these authorities is
                            assessed, and the assessments summarised in Conclusions.

  Re-branding a Sky-God
                            Early Christian History.
  Making One God out of
  Many                      Christians and others often assume that Jesus believed himself to
                            be divine, one of the three persons of a divine Trinity. There is
  How Mary keeps her        in fact no evidence at all for this, so a good follow up question
  Virginity                 is that of what Jesus believed himself to be according to the
                            earliest available documents and in the light of what is known
  Fabricating the Nativity  about Palestine two thousand years ago. Another is that if Jesus
  Story                     did not found the Christian religion, then who did found
                            Christianity? And how was doctrine created? And where did Christian
  Managing Inconvenient     ideas and practices come from?
  Texts
                            Related to these questions is the concept of Orthodoxy. Given the
                            contradictory and otherwise unsatisfactory nature of the various
                            Christian Authorities how can anyone know what constitutes the
  Christianity & Science    "correct" form of Christianity among the thousand of past and
                            present denominations? One particularly thorny issue is the idea of
  Traditional Battlegrounds a Christian priesthood, so the origin of the Priesthood is
                            investigated in some detail.

  Rational Explanations
                            Reviewing the development of Christian doctrines, ideas and
  Religion in General       practices reveals a number of techniques that have been employed to
                            enable Christianity to develop in the directions that its leaders
  Christianity in           have wanted to follow. These case studies show how these techniques
  Particular                have been employed to re-brand an Old Testament Sky-God as a more
                            acceptable Jewish and Christian God, to present the many gods
  Divine Human Beings       identified in the Old Testament as a single God, to maintain, that
                            Mary, the mother of Jesus, kept her Virginity before, during and
  Ease of Creating          after the birth of Jesus in the face of every possible sort of
  Religions                 contradictory evidence. Further case studies show how the familiar
                            Nativity Story was concocted from a number of unrelated Old
                            Testament passages and how inconvenient texts have been managed to
                            make them acceptable.
  Arguments for and Against
                             
  Popular Arguments
                            Christianity & Science
  Philosophical Arguments
                            According to many Christian apologists there cannot be any conflict
  Moral Arguments           between Christianity and science, since they deal with different
                            types of knowledge. They occupy different domains which do not
  Supernatural Arguments    overlap and so they cannot ever come into conflict. This view is
  Miracles                  open to challenge by reviewing traditional battlegrounds, including
  Revelation                Early Christian Attitudes to Science, and then specifically
  Faith                     Cosmology, Mathematics and Physics, Biology, Earth Science, 
                            Chemistry, Pharmacy and Medicine, Philology, Philosophy. In these
  Practical Arguments       the battles are now fought and have been decided. There are also a
                            number of modern battlegrounds including Evolution and Genetics, 
                            Creation Science, and Origins of Life, some of which have important
                            consequences

  Social Issues
  Slavery                   Rational Explanations
  Racism
  Capital Punishment        One explanation for Christianity is that it is the One True
  Penal Reform              religion. But this is not the only possible explanation for the
  Physical Abuse            existence of Christianity. There are a number of non-theological
  Treatment of Women        explanations for the existence of religion in general and for
  Contraception             Christianity in particular. Of particular significance is a
  Abortion                  universal human tendency to assign divinity to ordinary human
  Divorce                   beings and a remarkable human proclivity to believe in even the
  Family Values             most unlikely religions, including unlikely Christian sects.

  The Physically Ill

  The Poor
  Animals                   A number of arguments have been advanced in support of
  Ecology                   Christianity, for example purporting to prove the existence of God.
                            These have been divided into five categories. Popular Arguments are
  Persecution               arguments that are commonly put forward by believers. Philosophical
  Persecutions of           Arguments are more sophisticated reasoned arguments that have
  Christians                engaged philosophers in the past. Moral Arguments boil down to
  Persecutions by           variations on a theme that Christians have a demonstrably superior
  Christians                moral code in comparison to non-Christians. Arguments from
                            Miracles, Revelation & Faith rely upon evidence of the supernatural
    • "Heathens"            (Miracles such as Stigmata, and miracles worked by relics, saints, 
    • Witches               healers and other miracle workers, and visionary prophets);
    • Heretics              Revealed knowledge is knowledge supposedly provided by supernatural
    • Schismatics           agency; and Faith, it is claimed, provides its own proof of the
    • Cathars               existence of God and the truth of Christianity. Finally some
    • Jews                  practical Practical Arguments are presented, assessing Christian
    • Inquisition Victims   claims against what would reasonably be expected of a true
    • Philosophers          religion.
    • Freethinkers
    • Blasphemers            
    • Apostates
    • Humanists             The Record of Christianity
    • Pantheists
    • Unitarians            In line with the Moral Argument already mentioned, if Christianity
    • Deists                was the one true religion, or was divinely inspired, then
    • Atheists              Christians should be able to demonstrate a superior morality and a
                            superior moral record. Thus Christians would have a better record
  Church & State            on Social Issues (such as Slavery, Racism, Capital Punishment, 
  Symbiosis                 Penal Reform, Physical Abuse, Treatment of Women, Contraception, 
  Meddling in Governance    Abortion, Divorce, Family Values, Children, Romanies, The
  Interference in Politics  Physically Ill, The Mentally Ill, The Poor, Animals, and the 
                            Environment). Christians would have endured Persecutions of
  Abuse of Power            Christians without carrying out Persecutions themselves. Again,
  Church Law and Justice    Christians would have a good influence on the governance of
  Exemption from the Law    Christian States (for example creating a constructive Symbiosis
  Unofficial Exemption      between Church & State, not Meddling in National Governments, and
  Financial Privileges      exercising a positive influence in politics). Christians would have
  Control Over Education    exercised a sensitive and positive influence over all aspects of
                            Sex, would have promoted research into Science & Medicine, would
  Human Rights              have a record of opposing Violence & Warfare, and no record of
  Freedom of Belief         Cultural Vandalism. As Christianity does not always live up to
  Religious Toleration      expectations, some Possible Explanations are considered and the
  Freedom of Expression     evidence Summed up.

  Attitudes to Sex
  Celibacy                  Continuing Influence
  Sex Within Marriage
  Sex Outside Marriage      Although the power of the Christian Church is much reduced in the
  Incest                    modern world, it still exercises influence. All countries in the
  Rape                      world Discriminate in favour of at least one religion. Many
  Homosexuality             discriminate in favour of Christianity. In particular the Churches
  Transvestism              still affect modern morality and exercise considerable residual
  Prostitution              power.
