This group is mainly to get like-minded individuals connected and together to
socialize. As Atheists/Agnostics/Humanists/Freethinkers may feel like the
minority in almost all regions of America, statistically we are doing pretty
good. This is an attempt to reach out to those in the greater Phoenix area
offering a chance to meet others, to discuss positive activism in the community
and  politics and build a network of thinking, rational people. We'd like this
to be a safe landing spot for life long atheists or those who may have just
left a religious group and are looking for a place with open minded people.
(The administration of this group does not accept bigotry or behaviors rooted
in racism. No hatheists please. If you are bringing that please look
elsewhere.)

We're 2,634 Atheist
