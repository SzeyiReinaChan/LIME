The Fellowship of Reason®  (Atlanta, Georgia) is a reason-based moral community
 our first meeting was Sunday, November 1, 1998.

“What if we all lived as if this were our only life, with reason and knowledge
as our truest guides? Join us as we endeavor to flourish together. Come delight
in our fellowship, shared interests, cerebration of achievements, and love of
life-long learning.”

As you explore our website you will find that our members are very excited by
continuing adult education. We have book clubs, a poetry group, and a
taped-lecture group.

Our primary focus during our premier event, called FORum, is ethics. Currently,
we are exploring the Aristotelian idea that the goal of moral activity is The
Beautiful.

Our FOR Sunday school is currently studying The Beautiful. Sunday School is
10:00- 10:30 a.m. first Sunday of the month, followed by FORum at 11:00 – 12:00
a.m. Most of us continue with lunch at a nearby family-friendly restaurant.

A Children’s Program and supervised play time is available for both events.
Coming soon is a new program for teens and pre-teens.

If you are interested in ethics and education, you may enjoy our community.
