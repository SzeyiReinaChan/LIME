This Week

Avoiding the TRAP: Defending Legal Abortion, with David A. Grimes, M.D.

January 19, 2016

Host: Lindsay Beyerstein

[435A9241]

This week Point of Inquiry welcomes Dr. David Grimes, a board certified
physician in obstetrics and gynecology and author of the new book Every Third
Woman in America: How Legal Abortion Transformed Our Nation. Dr. Grimes talks
with host Lindsay Beyerstein about the enormous good that’s been done as a
result of the legalization of abortion, and the horrors that women used to face
— and face anew — as access to abortion services is chipped away.

A powerful movement is relentlessly fighting to turn back the clock to the
pre-Roe v. Wade era, when abortions were just as common as they are today, but
far more dangerous and life-threatening. States across the country have seen
the introduction and passage of “TRAP laws” (Targeted Regulation of Abortion
Providers) that harshly restrict access to abortion, birth control, and even
cancer screenings, all under the pretense of protecting patients’ health.
