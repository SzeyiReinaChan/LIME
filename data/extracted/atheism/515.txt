South Jersey Humanists is an Atlantic City, NJ based group of secular
humanists, atheists, agnostics, freethinkers, skeptics, infidels, brights, or
whatever designation you prefer.

Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism and other
supernatural beliefs, affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical
lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity.  In
a nutshell, it is the thought that people can be good without god.
