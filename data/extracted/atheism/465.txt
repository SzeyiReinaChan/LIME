This is a different kind of singles group oriented toward non-religious people
of all ages, backgrounds, sexual orientation, and gender. Whether you call
yourself an atheist, agnostic, bright, disbeliever, freethinker, humanist,
nonbeliever, pastafarian, rationalist, secular humanist, skeptic, "spiritual
but not religious," or simply were not raised in with an organized religion and
have no interest in one, you are welcome to this group! This group is open to
singles from all around the Chicago area and suburbs, because we'd like to see
events scheduled throughout the Chicago area. In order to accomplish that goal,
we're looking for assistant organizers who can suggest places to meet or
activities local to their area. Please contact the organizer if interested. We
would also welcome advertisers and sponsorships from restaurants, bars, or
other locations that might be good for meeting. For non-members with questions
about the group, please use the "email me" link at the left under the
organizer's name.
