Group Description

Greenville Nontheists -- home of the Happy Heretics. All backsliders & infidels
are welcome.

Whether you call yourself, identify with, or are just curious about (WARNING:
long litany of keywords to snag people searching for us, whether they know it
or not) freethinkers & freethought; atheist, atheists, & atheism; agnostic,
agnostics, & agnosticism; nontheist & nontheism; humanist, humanists, &
humanism; or bright, brights & ...brightism; we hope you'll make yourself at
home.

GN exists chiefly to help folks who don't fit in with the prevailing
religiousness in Upstate South Carolina find a sense of community. We're here
to connect, discuss, be active, have fun, pitch in, and otherwise be ourselves
-- and hopefully show the other locals that nonbelievers are people, too; that
we're not out to corrupt their youth, teach their monkeys to fly, or force them
to give up their comfortable beliefs under threat of torture.

While the occasional good-natured debate is allowed, anybody who gets pushy or
rude will at the list owner's discretion be warned, placed on moderated status,
and ultimately kicked out if such behavior continues. This includes, but is not
limited to, anybody who joins up to preach mercilessly at us hellbound heathens
and show us the error of our ways.

Otherwise, pretty much any topic is okay, as long as it stays reasonably
polite. So jump on in, make friends, and play nice.
