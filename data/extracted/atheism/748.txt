O'Hair vs. Religious Broadcasting
*
Part 1: The rumor that wouldn't die

    The rumor that the FCC has before it a proposal to deny licenses to
    religious broadcasters still continues to circulate, 25 years after the
    Commission denied that request.
              Federal Communications Commission

    I don't think it's going to die out or ever be debunked successfully. No
    matter how hard we try to debunk it, there will be people who haven't seen
    it and will help spread the rumor the next time around.
              Jan Harold Brunvand, folklorist

By David Emery

Over a quarter of a century ago, two broadcasters petitioned the FCC to
consider disqualifying religious organizations from being licensed to broadcast
on channels reserved for noncommercial educational use. Eight months later,
citing the First Amendment requirement "to observe a stance of neutrality
toward religion, acting neither to promote nor to inhibit religion," the
Commission rejected the petition.

That ought to have been the end of it.

Unfortunately, wildly inaccurate rumors had already surfaced among Christian
groups to the effect that the 1975 petition had been instigated by the infamous
atheist Madalyn Murray O'Hair and that it called for a ban on all religious
programming, including even Christmas carols. By the time the FCC announced its
ruling, it had received an estimated 700,000 letters of protest from people who
misunderstood both the origin and nature of the petition. In spite of the
Commission's best efforts to correct them, these misunderstandings persisted
well beyond that date. In fact, they persist to this day.

One reason they haven't gone away is that during the height of the hysteria in
1975, a counter-petition codifying the false charges was drawn up and
circulated to "concerned Christians" everywhere, who were urged to sign and
copy it. Nothing gives a rumor staying power like the printed word.

From snail mail to Fax to email, all available means have been used to keep the
document in constant circulation ever since. A recent example follows (analysis
on next page).

(NOTE: As of 1999, a newer variant exists beginning with this false statement:
"CBS will be forced to discontinue 'Touched By An Angel' for using the word
'God' in every program."  It is otherwise identical to the following.)


  PLEASE HELP!!! WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN TO OUR COUNTRY!!!

  Madeline Marray O'Hare, an atheist, whose efforts successfully eliminated
  the use of Bible reading and prayer from public schools fifteen years ago,
  has now been granted a federal hearing in Washington D.C., on the same
  subject, by the Federal Communications Commission. (FCC)

  Her petition, No. 2493, would ultimately pave the way to stop any reading
  of the Gospel of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, on the airwaves of
  America. She took her petition with 287,000 signatures to back her stand.
  If her attempt is successful, all Sunday Worship services being broadcast,
  either by radio or television, will stop! Ms. O'Hare is also campaigning to
  remove all CHRISTMAS PROGRAMS, CHRISTMAS SONGS AND CHRISTMAS CAROLS from
  Public Schools.

  You can help this time! We need 1,000,000 (one million) signed letters.
  This would defeat Ms. O'Hare and show that there are many CHRISTIANS ALIVE,
  WELL AND CONCERNED FOR OUR COUNTRY. This petition is #2493.

  Cut off, sign and mail the form. Please do not sign jointly as Mr. & Mrs.
  EACH PERSON SHOULD SIGN ONE SEPARATELY AND MAIL IT IN A SEPARATE
  ENVELOPE!!!!! (Helps us get 1,000,000 faster). Be sure to put Petition #
  2493 on the outside of the envelope before mailing the letter.

  CHRISTIANS MUST UNITE ON THIS! PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS LIGHTLY; WE DID ONCE
  AND LOST PRAYER IN SCHOOLS AND IN OFFICES ACROSS THE NATION!!!

  The only way for EVIL to flourish is for GOOD men to do NOTHING!!

  RE: Petition #3492
  Washington, D.C. 20054

  Gentlemen:

  I am an American and am very thankful for my American heritage. I am also
  much aware of the role our Christian Faith has in the freedom that we
  Americans now enjoy. Therefore, I protest any human effort to remove from
  the radio or television; programs designed to nurture faith in God or to
  remove CHRISTMAS PROGRAMS, CHRISTMAS SONS AND CHRISTMAS CAROLS from public
  airwaves, schools, office buildings, etc.

  Sincerely:
