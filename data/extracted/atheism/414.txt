Monterey County Atheists is a secular community group. The purpose of the group
is to support a growing community of freethinkers through social gatherings and
community outreach. We value science education. We support the strict
separation of church and state. MCAtheists is dedicated to persuading atheists
to be open about their lack of faith with family, friends, and coworkers. The
strong level of distrust of atheists and our lack of political power are
directly linked to the fact that people don't know that they know an atheist.
There are many more of us out there than anyone knows.

Join MCAtheists if you are an anti-theist, an atheist, an agnostic, or even if
you are simply curious or "struggling" with doubts about your current religion.
We look forward to meeting you and engaging in rational and respectful
conversation.

We're 133 Atheists
