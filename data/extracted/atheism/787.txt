We've been having ongoing problems with double posts, all of which are
being produced by the Quick Reply window. So we have turned off the QR
function. You'll have to use the Post Reply button to post in threads.
Within the next month or two, we'll be switching to a newer version of
vBulletin, and at that point we'll turn the QR window back on. We know
this is a bit inconvenient, but dealing with all the dp's is even more
so!
