    “At bottom every man knows well enough that he is a unique being, only once
    on this earth; and by no extraordinary chance will such a marvelously
    picturesque piece of diversity in unity as he is, ever be put together a
    second time.” 
    ― Friedrich Nietzsche--Untimely Meditations

    “Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they are
    presented with evidence that works against that belief, the new
    evidence cannot be accepted. It would create a feeling that is
    extremely uncomfortable, called cognitive dissonance. And because it
    is so important to protect the core belief, they will rationalize,
    ignore and even deny anything that doesn't fit in with the core belief.”
    ― Frantz Fanon, Black Skin, White Masks     

    “There is no reality except in action. Man is nothing else than his plan;
    he exists only to the extent that he fulfills himself; he is therefore
    nothing else than the ensemble of his acts, nothing else than his life.”
    ― Jean-Paul Sartre, Existentialism Is a Humanism
