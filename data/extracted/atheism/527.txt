We are the largest and most active group of atheists, agnostics, skeptics,
freethinkers, humanists, and other nonbelievers in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel
Hill, NC area. This group is a place to meet and socialize with other
nonbelievers in a supportive environment. There are very few rules and
regulations in here so enjoy the freedom to discuss whatever you want so long
as you keep it civil and respectful of other members.

Have fun!

Alex,
