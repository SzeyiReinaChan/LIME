Our goal is to create a local Humanist group for the Northwest Arkansas area
and adhere to the goals and initiatives of the AHA.

From the American Humanist Association homepage:

The American Humanist Association has stood as the voice of humanism in the
United States for over 70 years. We strive to bring about a progressive society
where being good without gods is an accepted way to live life. We are
accomplishing this through our defense of civil liberties and secular
governance, by our outreach to the growing number of people without traditional
religious faith, and through a continued refinement and advancement of the
humanist worldview.

Humanism encompasses a variety of nontheistic views (atheism, agnosticism,
rationalism, naturalism, secularism, and so forth) while adding the important
element of a comprehensive worldview and set of ethical values---values that
are grounded in the philosophy of the Enlightenment, informed by scientific
knowledge, and driven by a desire to meet the needs of people in the here and
now.

We count humanists and other nontheists as the core of our movement but are
always willing to work with friends and allies on issues of common concern. The
positions we hold and the actions we take are not simply for our own benefit,
but for the betterment of all of society and the world in which we live.
