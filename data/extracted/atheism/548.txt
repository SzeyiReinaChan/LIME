Welcome to Siouxland Freethinkers!

Siouxland Freethinkers is a community of secularists, scientific skeptics, and
non-religious people. We encourage and support critical thinking
skills and science based methods of inquiry unfettered by supernatural beliefs
or dogma. We also support our secular form of government as a necessary
condition for the independent rights of freedom of religion and freedom from
religion. We conduct a variety of meetings, outreach, and social events to
foster relationships with other freethinking minds.

    Are Christians allowed to join in conversations or attend meetings? I am
    interested in hearing about your beliefs and such.

        Yes. We are an inclusive group. Some of our members are even Christian.
