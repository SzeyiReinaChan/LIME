Welcome Back To The USA

November 11, 2015
This one’s for our nation’s servicemen and women. Complex, this War thing, but
those that offer up their bodies and their lives are to be commended. May
decisions which affect them be made wisely. Here’s the video.

New work of brilliance. I bring you: Utrecht.

Now On Pandora!

October 19, 2015
Hey Hey Hey! Been a while. Fine, thanks. And you? Psyched to announce that my
music can now be found on Pandora. Just type in “Eric Schwartz” in the “Create
Station” and you’ll hear me and a stream of songs in the Eric Schwartz style
(Tenacious D, Weird Al, Henry Phillips etc.). Great way to hear new music in
styles you like. If you’d prefer not to hear certain artists in the mix, just
click the thumbs down button when their music comes up. That’s all. Enjoy!
Thanks, Eric
