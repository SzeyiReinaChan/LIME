With members from all over Central Massachusetts, Greater Worcester Humanists
is an active chapter of the American Humanist Association. We provide a
welcoming environment and a range of activities for area humanists,
freethinkers, atheists, skeptics and agnostics.

We are a hub of activity for humanism in Greater Worcester, raising public
awareness and acceptance of humanism and thereby strengthening the progressive,
reason-based worldview in our area and providing resistance to the
ultraconservative views of the religious right. Humanism is a movement of
diverse individuals, and therefore GWH welcomes humanists from all backgrounds.
We value humanity's diversity of race, gender, age, ethnicity, and sexual
orientation.

We have regular meetings, guest speakers, movie screenings, discussions of
timely topics, and social activities, etc. We also celebrate humanist holidays
such as Darwin Day, Freethought Day, Human Light, and the National Day of
Reason. Most of our meetings are free and open to the public. We meet on the
second Tuesday of most months, usually at the UU Church (no affiliation) in
Worcester, MA and have other social events that will be listed at this site and
on our website worcesterhumanists.org.

If you would like to become a paying member our dues are $40 per year. This
pays for speaker fees, speaker travel, food at our annual picnic, supplies for
meetings and more. Please consider joining! Click HERE to join online or join
at our next monthly meeting.
