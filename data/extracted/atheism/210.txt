TRUE TRUTHS
Finally, the real truth about organized religion.

Deceit.  Hatred.  Intolerance.  Mind control.  Threats of eternal damnation. 
Sexual and psychological abuse.  War and death.  911.

Religion, created and promulgated by man, is a major player in these and
countless other atrocities and abuses of the human mind, body and spirit. 
Billions remain shackled by the fears and superstitions forced upon them by
religious leaders, whose only claim to authority is the one they falsely claim
God has given them.

True Truths gives information and ideas to help all thinking people arrive at
their own truths, based on fact and common sense, not on falsehoods, coercion,
and myths.
