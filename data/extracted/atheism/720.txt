             Strobel Says that Wallace Says that Ehrman Says...

             In "The Case for the Real Jesus," Lee Strobel
             attempts to discredit Bart Ehrman's book,
             "Misquoting Jesus," using his interview with
             Daniel Wallace as his "argument". Here is a video
             clip of Strobel summarizing his attack on Ehrman:

             In this video, as in his book, Strobel objects to
             Ehrman's critical position, but doesn't address
             any of the important points. Strobel instead talks
             about those variants whose differences don't
             matter to his understanding of Jesus. He carefully
             avoids any mention of the differences that really
             do matter. Some of those important variants are
             listed in this review of Misquoting Jesus. See
             especially the section entitled, "Variants That
             Matter".

             Temporal-Lobes Seizure

             Part 1

             embed(http://www.youtube.com/v/qIiIsDIkDtg)

             Some people have all the "luck". Thanks to a
             natural brain disorder, Temporal-Lobes Epilepsy,
             they are able to "see God". I can't help but
             wondering how big a role disorders like these
             played in the development the world's religions.
             Whatever the answer, I think temporal-lobes
             seizeres can help us learn a lot about our own
             beliefs, and experiences.
