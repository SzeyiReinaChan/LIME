Women For Sobriety, Inc. is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping
women overcome alcoholism and other addictions. It is, in fact, the first
national self-help program for women alcoholics. Our "New Life" Program helps
achieve sobriety and sustain ongoing recovery. WFS has been providing services
to women alcoholics since July, 1976. The WFS "New Life" Program grew out of
one woman's search for sobriety.

WFS self-help groups are found all across this country and abroad. Based upon a
Thirteen Statement Program of positivity that encourages emotional and
spiritual growth, the "New Life" Program has been extremely effective in
helping women overcome their addictions and embrace a new positive lifestyle.
For additional support, subscribe to our monthly newsletter, Sobering Thoughts,
which is available free electronically through our Email Updates Service.
