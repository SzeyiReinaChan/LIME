[thunker-ma]What's going on: Atheist Cartoons and Comics, Freethinking
Entertainment and Freethinking News Bites--this is Freethunk.
I've made some decisions on Freethunk.net and its future. In full disclosure, I
was actually thinking of closing the site altogether as I've moved on to so
many other projects, but I'm not sure that's the right thing to do. So it seems
the better option is to simply filter out what I don't like about the site and
also transition the site to support eBook publishing, which is where my main
interest lies. This means that a lot of the free to read cartoons may be
removed and that I will be filtering through past articles, reviews and news
I've posted and deleting ones I don't like, contain mistakes or were just
poorly written. I know that can be SEO suicide, but I'm not sure I care. I hate
feeling trapped by the idea that I have to keep everything I have ever wrote or
drawn online forever. Sometimes you have to clean house and move to another
stage in your life. I'm not sure when this will all take place, probably by the
end of the year, so if you like reading blasphemous cartoons or atheist humor
dive in while you can. As always, thank you to all the people who visit and
comment, those of faith and those without.
ALSO, on Facebook. Facebook Page for Freethunk is here.
