Australians! ‘Matilda and Me’ will air on ABC TV later this year!

by Shell 20th Jan 2016 | 5 comments

Matilda and Me

Charting the intimate relationship between Tim and the multi-award-winning
musical, for which he is now internationally known, Matilda and Me is a family
documentary which will air on ABC TV later this year.

The rehearsals for the highly anticipated Matilda The Musical in Australia form
the backdrop to the story, as the new Australian cast prepare to launch the
show in Sydney.

Directed by Nel Minchin and Rhian Skirving, the film looks at Tim’s long-term
fascination with author Roald Dahl and at how he went from being a virtually
unknown lyricist and composer, in Australia, to debuting his first musical on a
West End Stage.

There’s a mix of archive footage (including rare family moments), interviews,
musical performance and Australian Matilda The Musical rehearsals. Specially
shot footage of Tim globetrotting between LA, London and Sydney, culminates
with his return home for the triumphant opening night of Matilda The Musical in
Australia.

Matilda and Me is an ABC TV/In Films co-production.

We’ll announce the air date as soon as it’s confirmed. There’s no word yet as
to whether this will become available outside Australia but, as always, we’ll
let you know if we hear anything.

    Tim plays in support of MND Australia: Behind the scenes at The Fading
    Symphony!

    by Shell 9th Dec | 3 comments

    FadingSymphony4_ © Copyright Shirley Cai 2015

    Hopefully you’ve already spotted that Tim and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra
    (SSO) have been working with MND Australia on The Fading Symphony, a
    campaign to raise awareness and funds: for research into finding a cure, to
    support people living with MND and for global projects fighting ALS/MND.
    (If you’ve not yet seen the video then you might like to pop over here to
    watch it before reading on).

    Motor neurone disease (MND), sometimes also referred to as ALS, is a
    progressive terminal neurological disease with no known cure or effective
    treatment. Each day in Australia two people die from and two people are
    diagnosed with MND, which can strike men or women, young or old, from any
    country, race or demographic. People living with the disease progressively
    lose the use of their limbs and the ability to speak, swallow and breathe
    whilst their mind and senses usually remain intact.

    The Fading Symphony sees Tim and the SSO, at the Sydney Recital Hall,
    performing a moving rendition of Neil Finn’s Crowded House hit Don’t Dream
    It’s Over. As they play, they poignantly illustrate the progression of the
    debilitating symptoms; highlighting the physical impacts metaphorically
    through deteriorating performances by the artists. As Tim and the orchestra
    fall silent a donation is requested, following which the orchestra comes
    back to life and plays on, flourishing to an uplifting crescendo.

    Tim: “I love playing with the SSO, I have aways loved this song, and I
    loved this idea the minute it was presented to me. Music has the capacity
    to make us emotionally connect to stories like nothing else. Except,
    perhaps, silence.”

    If you haven’t already, please watch below or at thefadingsymphony.com and
    donate:

    Please donate $5 (or £s or €s!) at thefadingsymphony.com/donate to help the
    fight against MND and watch Tim and the orchestra heal and play on!
