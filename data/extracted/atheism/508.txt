This group is for freethinkers and non-believers of all sorts. We get together
to discuss philosophy, movies, religion, the arts, or any other funny thing
that comes into our head. No real requirements to join...we have no dogma, no
dress code, and no inhibitions! Sinners are free to join, without need for
repentence. We enjoy life in the here and now, without need for an afterlife.
If you thought you were all alone because you had no need of God(s), you're
alone no more. This is the group for you.
