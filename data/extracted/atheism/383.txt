This is a social group for Atheists and Agnostics. Our members may also
identify as Non-Religious, Skeptics, Humanists, Freethinkers, Naturalists,
Rationalists, Secularists and others. Whether we agree or respectfully
disagree, we seek to form friendships and build our own community through
fellowship.

Anyone from any part of Alaska is welcome to post events or announcements
related to Atheism, Agnosticism and Freethought... but most activities tend to
be in the Anchorage area because a vast majority of our members live in and
around Alaska's largest city


We're 476 Alaskan Atheists
