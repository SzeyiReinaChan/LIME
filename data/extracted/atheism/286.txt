Secular Organization for Sobriety - Winnipeg

 

 

 

or Save Our Selves

  â€¢ Home


There is a new support group for addicted individuals in Winnipeg, Manitoba.


For those persons who are uncomfortable with the

 

 

spiritual content of widely available 12-step programs,

 

 

the alternative is Secular Organizations for Sobriety /

 

 

Save Our Selves. SOS offers a self-empowerment,

 

 

secular approach to recovery based on individual

 

 

responsibility for one's "sobriety priority".

Meetings are every

Tuesday at 7:00 p.m.

University of Winnipeg

Lockhart Hall

Room 1L06

Near Ellice Avenue entrance
