"We are a way for the cosmos to know itself." - Carl Sagan

This club is here to encourage in-person conversations amongst Idahoans with a
naturalistic worldview. If you are free of belief in the "supernatural", enjoy
Reason and Science, and want to meet others with similar views, you are in the
right place!

We meet the first and third Monday of every month at 6:30PM at Papa Joe's
Banquet Room (wheel chair accessible) near the BSU campus.

You can also find us on Facebook.

We're 224 human beings

Join us!
