                    jail them for
                    offenses dubbed
                    blasphemy, it
                    said.

                    The study, The
                    Freethought
                    Report 2013, was
                    issued by the
                    International
                    Humanist and
                    Ethical Union
                    (IHEU), a global
                    body uniting
                    atheists,
                    agnostics and
                    other religious
                    skeptics, to

                    Tuesday.

                    "This report
                    shows that the
                    overwhelming
                    majority of
                    countries fail
                    to respect the
                    rights of
                    atheists and
                    freethinkers
                    although they
                    have signed U.N
                    agreements to
                    treat all
                    citizens
                    equally," said
                    IHEU President
                    Sonja Eggerickx.

                    The study
                    covered all 192
                    member states in
                    the world body
                    and involved
                    lawyers and
                    human rights
                    experts looking
                    at statute
                    books, court
                    records and
                    media accounts
                    to establish the
                    global
                    situation.

                    A first survey
                    of 60 countries
                    last year showed
                    just seven where
                    death, often by
                    public
                    beheading, is
                    the punishment
                    for either
                    blasphemy or
                    apostasy -
                    renouncing
                    belief or
                    switching to
                    another religion
                    which is also
                    protected under
                    U.N. accords.

                    But this year's
                    more
                    comprehensive
                    study showed six
                    more, bringing
                    the full list to
                    Afghanistan,
                    Iran, Malaysia,
                    Maldives,
                    Mauritania,
                    Nigeria,
                    Pakistan, Qatar,
                    Saudi Arabia,
                    Somalia, Sudan,
                    United Arab
                    Emirates and
                    Yemen.

                    In others, like
                    India in a
                    recent case
                    involving a
                    leading critic
                    of religion,
                    humanists say
                    police are often
                    reluctant or
                    unwilling to
                    investigate
                    murders of
                    atheists carried
                    out by religious
                    fundamentalists.

                    Across the
                    world, the
                    report said,
                    "there are laws
                    that deny
                    atheists' right
                    to exist, revoke
                    their
                    citizenship,
                    restrict their
                    right to marry,
                    obstruct their
                    access to public
                    education,
                    prevent them
                    working for the
                    state...."

                    Criticism of
                    religious faith
                    or even academic
                    study of the
                    origins of
                    religions is
                    frequently
                    treated as a
                    crime and can be
                    equated to the
                    capital offense
                    of blasphemy, it
                    asserted.

                    The IHEU, which
                    has member
                    bodies in some
                    50 countries and
                    supporters in
                    many more where
                    such
                    organizations
                    are banned, said
                    there was
                    systematic or
                    severe
                    discrimination
                    against atheists
                    across the
                    27-nation
                    European Union.

                    The situation
                    was severe in
                    Austria,
                    Denmark,
                    Germany, Greece,
                    Hungary, Malta
                    and Poland where
                    blasphemy laws
                    allow for jail
                    sentences up to
                    three years on
                    charges of
                    offending a
                    religion or
                    believers.

                    In these and all
                    other EU
                    countries, with
                    the exception of
                    the Netherlands
                    and Belgium
                    which the report
                    classed as "free
                    and equal,"
                    there was
                    systemic
                    discrimination
                    across society
                    favoring
                    religions and
                    religious
                    believers.

                    In the United
                    States, it said,
                    although the
                    situation was
                    "mostly
                    satisfactory" in
                    terms of legal
                    respect for
                    atheists'
                    rights, there
                    were a range of
                    laws and
                    practices "that
                    equate being
                    religious with
                    being American."

                    In Latin America
                    and the
                    Caribbean,
                    atheists faced
                    systemic
                    discrimination
                    in most
                    countries except
                    Brazil, where
                    the situation
                    was "mostly
                    satisfactory,"
                    and Jamaica and
                    Uruguay which
                    the report
                    judged as "free
                    and equal."

                    Across Africa,
                    atheists faced
                    severe or
                    systemic
                    violations of
                    their rights to
                    freedom of
                    conscience but
                    also grave
                    violations in
                    several
                    countries,
                    including Egypt,
                    Libya and
                    Morocco, and
                    nominally
                    Christian
                    Zimbabwe and
                    Eritrea.
