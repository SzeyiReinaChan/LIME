London Atheist Activist Group (LAAGers!) is UK's LARGEST ATHEIST meetup
COMMUNITY, & is really about CRITICAL THINKING as a whole. Non-theists of any
description or location welcome to join. 'Agnostics', deists & religious
doubters also welcome. (We do have a few believers as members - we're happy to
engage in sincere dialogue with (almost!) anyone (not EDL etc), as long as your
faith position is declared upon joining, & honest and civil debate takes
place). Anyone globally can join (lively discussions online everyday), & events
incl. talks, activities & socials if you're living, working in or visiting
London. We remain a censorship-free zone, as always.

WHAT THEY'RE SAYING:

"Thanks for doing what you're doing. Together we can make significant progress
toward eradicating the faith virus". Peter Bohossian, Philosopher & author of
"Manual for creating atheists"

"This (stopping State funding for creationist nurseries) wouldn't have happened
without LAAG" Jonny Scaramanga, activist.

COMMUNITY: Atheism gets a bad press, so if you're nervous about what it'd be
like to join, click here & reviews will reassure you! You'll get a warm welcome
from an inclusive, friendly, fun & constructive community, of all ages/
backgrounds.

OUR PHILOSOPHY:

BEING ABOUT SERIOUS ISSUES DOESN'T HAVE TO MEAN UPTIGHT!  Enjoy yourself,  meet
people, have a laugh. We're about PEACEFUL PROMOTION & CELEBRATION OF REASON.
If you want to be active, that's great, but you'll make a difference just by
joining, as larger numbers mean we can speak up on issues such as ...

'Holy' book' excuses don't stop bigotry being bigotry...

[event_129116062]

SEPARATION OF STATE from SUPERSTITIONS

FREE EXPRESSION, ONE LAW FOR ALL

HUMAN (particularly CHILDRENS') RIGHTS above RELIGIOUS RITES

Faith = professing to know what you don't. The modern equivalent of looking at
chicken entrails for answers. Hardly something to brag about! It's a vice and a
'virus' that we want to immunise against, with critical thinking.

WHY LAAG is UNIQUE:

    UK Meetup's BUSIEST webforum - Daily discussions (serious & humorous!).
    (Many non-London & overseas members too)

    Frequent & varied events in Central & West London; debates, talks ranging
    from social issues to science, lectures, friendly pub meetups, exhibitions,
    picnics ...free speech is never censored or hindered (we recognise the
    difference between being against ideas or people!). CELEBRATIONS are also
    an important feature of the group.

    We explore serious issues (but embrace an unashamedly playful side, too)
    Our maxim: Humour often reaches where lectures don’t!

    Open debate - no censoring! Anywhere, forums, events. We're against
    censoring in any form for adults. Expect civil (no personal comments),
    friendly, AND frank.

    A peaceful activist platform (for those who want it - no pressure). We
    don't advocate 'forcing' atheism (it's an inevitable conclusion of thinking
    critically anyway!), we just want people to be ALLOWED to think for
    themselves, especially children. No violence/aggression, obviously, but no
    need for timidity either. Reason, critical thinking & egalitarianism are
    values to be promoted & celebrated - & we're confident, forthright and
    committed. We don't accept the term 'militant' - no militia is ever
    involved ;-) ...besides, atheism cures religious terrorism ;-)),

We facilitate & support (NO 'IMPOSING'!) doing *something* - whatever is right
for YOU, your circumstances, disposition etc ...even if it's 'just' silent
membership, or social only. Just by joining the group, you're already an
activist because you add to our weight to speak for those who can't help
themselves, so thank you.
