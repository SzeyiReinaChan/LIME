About

 

64

HNPS is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational organization committed to positive
social change through advocacy and education. We focus on issues relating to
the separation of church and state, the importance of a secular democracy,
human rights, environmental sustainability and peaceful solutions to global
problems.

60

Humanism embraces the principles of the Enlightenment that our Founding Fathers
fought so hard to establish and protect: education, science, reason, tolerance,
secular democracy, rule of law, self-government, fairness, civility and equal
rights for all.

66

Humanists believe that through education, reason and science, we can each live
fair, self-reliant, ethical and peaceful lives.

65

Humanists are among the 20% of Americans (and growing) who follow no religion
or other mythologies.

62

Humanists affirm that we must each take responsibility for our lives, our
communities and the world in which we live.

59

One of our fellow freethinkers, Thomas Paine, said, “We have it in our power to
start the world again.”

63

Creator or no creator, this is the only world we have and we must all work
together to preserve and protect it.
