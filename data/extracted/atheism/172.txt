    By bad meteorology, I do not mean bad weather.

    This page is about intellectual disasters, not weather disasters.

Examples of Bad Meteorology:

    [hand] The reason clouds form when air cools is that cold air
    cannot hold as much water vapor as warm air.                   [CloudSmall]

        Wash your hands of this  emetic explanation .
    
    [hand] Raindrops are shaped like teardrops.
                                                                   [RainSmall]
        Weep over this  artistic licentiousness .
    
    [hand] The greenhouse effect is caused when gasses in the
    atmosphere behave as a blanket and trap radiation which is
    then reradiated to the earth.                                  [GHEarth]

        Reject this explanation as nothing but  hot air .
    
    [hand] The water in a sink (or toilet) rotates one way as it
    drains in the northern hemisphere and the other way in the
    southern hemisphere. Called the Coriolis Effect, it is caused  [Pan]
    by the rotation of the earth.

        This nonsense deserves to be  flushed .
