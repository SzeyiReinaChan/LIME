  • "These days students get many writing assignments, for instance an argument
    or literature study. By having him make an argument map, as a summary, it`s
    much easier to assess whether the student has built up the argument
    properly and what the quality is of the use of sources. Argument maps are
    good tools to give depth to an assignment."

  • "Finally: a method that provides lecturers with real tools to help students
    getting their thinking and writing to a higher level. And even more: the
    execellent Rationale program helps you making a good structure for your
    reasoning, arguments, analyses and evaluation."http://www.reasoninglab.com/

  • "Before Rationale, I was only able to lecture at my students about the
    skill of evaluating arguments. After Rationale, I have the technology I
    need to help them actually acquire the skill."

  • My students saw the benefit of the program from the minute they started
    using it so I would be recommending it to the Assistant Principal.

  • Again, the single most helpful aspect about Rationale is how much it makes
    it easy (especially for visual learners) to critically think through the
    structure of their papers, speeches, debate positions, and other
    communication projects.  This is THE major step in the writing process that
    my students tend to gloss over--despite all my attempts to use other visual
    aids, outlining strategies, etc.  There's something about the dynamic
    interface, the color-coding and argument evaluation tools, and the ease of
    the Essay Planning tool that both speeds up and sharpens the thinking
    process involved in the creative process.

    ..Both Dr. Sager and I saw a huge gain in our Ethics Bowl participants'
    ability to prepare positions on these UW Ethics Bowl queries; and I saw
    similar clarity provided by Rationale with my freshmen in our Holt-McDougal
    Argumentation & Persuasion Unit culminating debates (see final
    attachment).'
