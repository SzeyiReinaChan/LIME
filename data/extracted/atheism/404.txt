  • Join us!

We are building a community for the new, fast growing, generation of atheist
Americans. This group is opened to atheists/agnostics in their 20's and 30's
who want to meet and talk with other like minded people.

Our monthly event is an informal late lunch. We talk about anything that's on
our mind, have some food and a few drinks. We also go bowling, play games and
join in community events like the annual AIDS Walk and Atheists United's
Highway Cleanup.

Bring your friends or come to meet new ones. We're the atheist community you've
been looking for!
