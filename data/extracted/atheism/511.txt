"Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without theism and other
supernatural beliefs, affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical
lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of Humanity" 
(American Humanist Association)

The Upper Valley Humanist Association's mission is to provide a fellowship
group for the non-religious based upon science, reason, empathy and compassion
for our community and our natural environment.

We can live moral, meaningful lives, in the service of something bigger than
ourselves, without religious doctrine. For us, "something bigger than
ourselves", refers to all humankind and the natural world, rather than a
supernatural being. Our hope is to create a fun and productive organization
that celebrates the best humanity and nature has to offer, while giving back in
a meaningful way, by organizing and executing local community service projects
in the name of Humanism. We wish to live in harmony with our religious
neighbors, therefore we will only support defensive activism.

"The Affirmations of Humanism: A statement of Principles"

by the Council for Secular Humanism

  • We are committed to the application of reason and science to the
    understanding of the universe and to the solving of human problems.
  • We deplore efforts to denigrate human intelligence, to seek to explain the
    world in supernatural terms, and to look outside nature for salvation.
  • We believe that scientific discovery and technology can contribute to the
    betterment of human life.
  • We believe in an open and pluralistic society and that democracy is the
    best guarantee of protecting human rights from authoritarian elites and
    repressive majorities.
  • We are committed to the principle of the separation of church and state.
  • We cultivate the arts of negotiation and compromise as a means of resolving
    differences and achieving mutual understanding.
  • We are concerned with securing justice and fairness in society and with
    eliminating discrimination and intolerance.
  • We believe in supporting the disadvantaged and the handicapped so that they
    will be able to help themselves.
  • We attempt to transcend divisive parochial loyalties based on race,
    religion, gender, nationality, creed, class, sexual orientation, or
    ethnicity, and strive to work together for the common good of humanity.
  • We want to protect and enhance the earth, to preserve it for future
    generations, and to avoid inflicting needless suffering on other species.
  • We believe in enjoying life here and now and in developing our creative
    talents to their fullest.
  • We believe in the cultivation of moral excellence.
  • We respect the right to privacy. Mature adults should be allowed to fulfill
    their aspirations, to express their sexual preferences, to exercise
    reproductive freedom, to have access to comprehensive and informed
    health-care, and to die with dignity.
  • We believe in the common moral decencies: altruism, integrity, honesty,
    truthfulness, responsibility. Humanist ethics is amenable to critical,
    rational guidance. There are normative standards that we discover together.
    Moral principles are tested by their consequences.
  • We are deeply concerned with the moral education of our children. We want
    to nourish reason and compassion.
  • We are engaged by the arts no less than by the sciences.
  • We are citizens of the universe and are excited by discoveries still to be
    made in the cosmos.
  • We are skeptical of untested claims to knowledge, and we are open to novel
    ideas and seek new departures in our thinking.
  • We affirm humanism as a realistic alternative to theologies of despair and
    ideologies of violence and as a source of rich personal significance and
    genuine satisfaction in the service to others.
  • We believe in optimism rather than pessimism, hope rather than despair,
    learning in the place of dogma, truth instead of ignorance, joy rather than
    guilt or sin, tolerance in the place of fear, love instead of hatred,
    compassion over selfishness, beauty instead of ugliness, and reason rather
    than blind faith or irrationality.
  • We believe in the fullest realization of the best and noblest that we are
    capable of as human beings.
