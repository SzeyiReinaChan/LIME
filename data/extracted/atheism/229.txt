Dudeists of the World Unite!

Dude Vinci illustration by Colin Cotterill (www.colincotterill.com)

Come join the slowest-growing religion in the world – Dudeism. An ancient
philosophy that preaches non-preachiness, practices as little as possible, and
above all, uh…lost my train of thought there. Anyway, if you’d like to find
peace on earth and goodwill, man, we’ll help you get started. Right after a
little nap.

First, you might want to
Get ordained as a Dudeist priest. There are almost 300,000 worldwide.

Please support our store.

And check out fun shtuff.

Take a look around by clicking on the page titles in the left column. We hope
you dig our style. Learn more at Dudeism’s library and please say hi at our
Forum.

Much obliged.

Dudeism is a religion deeply inspired by The Big Lebowski, as well as several
other traditions that predate Lebowski -
most particularly: Taoism, Zen Buddhism, American Transcendentalism and
humanism. However, it is not affiliated with the film in any way.
