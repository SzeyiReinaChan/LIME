Welcome to the largest local community of Atheists, Humanists,  Agnostics,
Freethinkers, Secular Humanists, Rationalists, and friends in the Washington DC
Metro Area!  We host a variety of events each month in DC, Suburban Maryland,
and Northern Virginia as well as active mailing lists on current events,
debate, and general discussion.

We're deeply concerned about maintaining Constitutional separation of Church
and State - but we're also interested in building a community.  With that in
mind, we offer a combination of social, educational, community service, and
activist events.  Also we hope to provide a supportive social environment for
anyone those who may be struggling to overcome religious indoctrination.

The suggested donation is strictly voluntary and is considered a contribution
to help offset the costs of running this group.  Financial contribution is not
required to become a member of the group, however they are appreciated.

We're 1,420 Atheists Humanists and Agnostics
