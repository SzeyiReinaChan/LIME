  No dogma. No creeds. Just religion-free. Well, some of us would like that,
anyway! But can we survive in a culture that floats in unquestioned faith, and
                      sees honest doubt as somehow evil?

                                        

History is a story of the climb from dogma to doubt. Skepticism threads it like
 veins of fire, heresy sparks from mind to mind, igniting them and shaping the
   ideas that shape us. Always it was the nonconformist thinker who bent the
                 first grasses, and led the way for the rest.

    So for “unchurched” Sacramento-area citizens, AOF is here: a freethought
                oasis, a comfort zone and a community of mind.

                                        

   Check us out. Learn about us. Above all, don't hesitate to doubt us, too.

                                        

No, you need not be an atheist to join. We agree only on the right to question,
  and a goal: to be a crucible and catalyst for a nation more rational, more
humane, more open, more accepting, and less dogmatic than what you may see now.

                                        

                        The door is open. Step this way.

                                        

                                  Our Mission

 

The purpose of Atheists and Other Freethinkers is to promote the civic
understanding of atheism and the acceptance of atheists in our community.
Through educational programs, projects, and publications, AOF will extend
secular perspectives, including the separation of religion and government and
the right to think and speak freely on these perspectives.

 

 

General Meetings of AOF are open to the public, and always free -- about six
meetings a year, most often at the Sacramento Reason Center, 1824 Tribute Rd. 
We have more frequent events and activities too: civic service projects,
dinners, movie outings, parties! To see what awaits you, click the
calendar, sign up for our newsletter, or simply contact us.
