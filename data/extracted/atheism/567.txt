Welcome Skeptics! Join Charlottesville's lively Skeptical community!  Founded
in 2006, we're in our tenth year of discussion dinners, happy hours, lectures,
picnics, seasonal parties, with more events planned each month!

What is Skepticism?

Skepticism," when it applies to the Skeptic movement, means valuing the use of
reason, rationality and the tools of science in our everyday lives.  (Note it
does not mean "cynicism" or simply "Hey, I'm skeptical about a lot of things so
this group must be right for me.")

Charlottesville Skeptics is part of a growing international movement known as
"modern skepticism" or "scientific skepticism," consisting of an informal
network of groups, writers and bloggers.  Prominent skeptical organizations
include the Center for Inquiry, the Skeptics Society, the Committee for
Skeptical Inquiry, the Richard Dawkins Foundation, the Council for Secular
Humanism, the American Humanist Association and the James Randi Educational
Foundation.  Well-known periodicals include Skeptic, Free Inquiry, The Humanist
, Humanist Network News and the Skeptical Inquirer.

Skepticism is a positive, not a negative trait.  We are gardeners of ideas,
weeding as needed so that good ideas may grow.  Most skeptics conclude that
nontheism flows naturally from the above.  In particular, Charlottesville
Skeptics has an especially close relationship with regional humanist groups, so
is therefore largely comprised of persons with nonreligious philosophies such
as humanists, atheists, agnostics, Brights, naturalists, and freethinkers.

And yes, we claim Thomas Jefferson as one of us!  We have little doubt if he
were alive today he'd be Charlottesville Skeptics' president emeritus.

Goals of  Charlottesville Skeptics

1) Provide fellowship and fun among skeptics.
2) Promote critical thinking and the integration of the scientific method into
our daily lives.
3) Increase understanding of the benefits of science to society.
4) Increase understanding of the negative impacts to society of poor science,
pseudoscience, and science devaluation.
5) Promote truth-seeking based on reason and evidence over dogma in solving
personal and societal problems.
