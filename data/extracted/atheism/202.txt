━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      Jesus'         "In The Beginning" of this trial, the invisible Biblical God was asked if He
Transfigured Body    was guilty of these Biblical Chapter & Verse crimes. God refused to answer. The
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   Biblical God's defense stated whether God was guilty or not was not relevant.
     Slavery         God was to be determined to be innocent - because He is God.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 Did Jesus Christ    Please jurors, stay alert. Awareness indicates that most Christian believers
       Lie?          are unable to pay sustained mental / emotional attention to exposed, negative
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   Bible C&V facts that are associated with their Biblical God.
   The Trinity
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   Ask yourself, what motive or reason did the Biblical God, real or fictional,
 The God Business    have to murder all those Human Beings? By knowing what the Bible documents, C
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   hapter & Verse (C&V) its God to have done, if the prosecution is correct, why
 Jesus Questions     do good people still believe in, worship, support, promote and finance this
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   murderous character?
Was Jesus Christ a
    Composite?       Bible Chapter & Verse (C&V) documentation proves that the Biblical God is the
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   most miserable, angry, vengeful, hostile, insane, jealous and murderous
Why Jesus Can Not    character in the entire Bible. God's plan never works for His own pleasure -
      Be God         unless pain, misery and murder was God's own pleasure. The prosecution can not
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   accuse the Bible of being any more monstrous and insane than its own Chapters
  Women In Jesus     and Verses document. Documented, Biblical facts are this trial's defense. That
 Christ's Lineage    is the law. The personal question is: Do you know all the selected Bible C&Vs
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   that document the murderous deeds of the Biblical God?
 Was Jesus Christ
 Ready to Fulfill    The "Easy English" Catholic Bible, the Jewish Torah, the King James Version
   His Destiny?      (KJV) Companion Bible are the three main sources where this documented Chapter

      Peter
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   The prosecution supports every Human Being's right to have their own personal

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   infringe their heavy-handed ideological and authoritative beliefs on others.
    Marriage &

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 The Devil (1899)    Please, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the United States of America is not a
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   country governed by Gods nor by men. The United State's Constitution documents
     "SATAN"         that the United States of America is a country governed by laws. No one is
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   above the law.
       Hell
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   Murder is murder no matter who commits it or why. The "because He is God"
      Heaven         defense does not fly in a land governed by laws. It has seemed that concerning
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   God, one is free to abandon not only common sense and science - but also the
      Angels         facts. This is the time to listen to, question and learn the facts.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    Salvation        The Biblical God is herein charged with about 180 counts of "The God Murders"
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   and God’s commands for His followers to murder other Human Beings - to fulfill
A Salvation Debate   God's personal agendas.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
     FASCISM         The Biblical God had one main theme throughout the Old Testament: If you do not
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   obey Me - I will kill you. Those Israelites had no Satan, Heaven or Hell. Their
 How Christianity    God did it all.
     Operates
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   The Biblical God is documented to be the most miserable, frustrated, hateful,
    Christian        jealous, discriminatory and murderous character in the entire Bible.
    Conversion
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   Judeo-Christian believers have righteously claimed that "God had His reasons"
 God Versus Satan    to murder anyone He chose to murder. So does every murderer on death-row have
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   his or her insane reasons for being there. Under fair and just law - blind
   Genesis The       justice - in determining guilt, does not peek to see who is accused of the
     Creation        crime.

 Jeremiah - God's    Bailiff: All rise. This court is now in session.
     Prophet
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   Judge: (gavel) The prosecutor is to give his opening statement and, a careful
  God's Biblical     warning sir, as I suspect that you will be quite often in contempt of my
      Heroes         "God-fearing" court. I am a Christian and unless you provide hard, legally
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   bound, documented evidence, I will not tolerate insolent charges nor will I
     Abraham         entertain any disrespectful, inflammatory nonsense.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
       Lot           Prosecutor: Thank you, you're honor. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I'm Gary
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   DeVaney. It is impossible to be critical of evil while you praise it. It is
      Isaac          improbable for you to defeat what you defend. As the prosecutor of the God of
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   the Bible, I take legal issue with selected Bible C&V charges that the defense
      Jacob          will attempt to discount, aviod, defend and support. The jury is to judge the
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   innocence or guilt of each count of murder as required by law. Judging all
      Moses          sides of each controversial, legal issue is important. Emotion has no play
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   here. This is a court of law. As a juror, you have a legal oath to rule on the
     Joshua　        evidence. I ask that you do exactly that.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
     Jephthah        The question is the highest form of thought. This is the time for you to think
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   and for you to question. Most believers can not question concerning what they
      Samson         believe. When a believer can not question, thinking does not take place and he
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   or she remains mind-set. The no-win paradox for the believer is - if they do
    King Saul        question what they believe - they prove not to believe. That alone usually
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   paralyzes the believer's ability to judge the murderous God of the Bible as
    King David       evident and documented by Bible C&V. Please, do not believe me or any other
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   man. Judge, for yourself the evidence - the selected Bible C&Vs. You are the
   King Solomon      only thinker in your sense of reality.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
      Elijah         Judge: Counsel will approach the bench. Sir, if you think that you can
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   chip-away at the sacred mind-set of hope, faith and belief in my courtroom, you
      Elisha         will be in contempt of my court and I will see that you spend eternity in jail.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   If I want the jury to think - I'll tell them what to think. You understand me?

God Was Tempted by   Genesis 6:7 The Biblical God said: (CONFESSION) I will destroy man. (MOTIVE) I

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   Additional Bible testimony: In Luke 17:27 Jesus Christ testified: Noah entered

    Other Gods
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   Prosecutor: I charge the Biblical God with murdering almost every Human

  Naked Charges      documentation and especially if you will accept Jesus Christ's testimony as an
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   expert witness.
The Promised Land
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   Defense: Objection! Your honor, the defense objects to the prosecutor's

   "Free-Will"       Defense: Objection! The jury is directed to believe that God is innocent of

    The Secret
  Importance Of      Judge: Continue.
     Religion
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   Prosecutor: Judge, George Orwell, in his famous novel "1984", called something
     Miracles        "the memory hole". It was Winston Smith's job at the Ministry of Truth to make
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   disappear all facts embarrassing to Big Brother.
 The Naked Truth
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   Defense: Objection! Judge, the prosecutor is referring to a George Orwell novel
Model Of Immunity    - which is pure fantasy. The Bible is not fantasy. The Bible is pure reality!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    DeVaney's        Prosecutor: Thank you, sir. If that is the case, the Biblical God is guilty of
  Collection of      all these murders. On the other hand, how realistic is someone who believes in
    Scenarios        a human "virgin birth" and then believes that the same man, who is dead
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   supposedly for 3 days and 3 nights - which measures out to be about a day and a

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Is God Omnipotent    Judge: I won't argue trivial nonsense. Objection sustained.
 / Omnipresent /
   Omniscient?       5. Exodus 9:23-25 God murdered by hail every man that was outdoors.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    Radio Show       Prosecutor: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, if you support this God, you
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   support all these documented murders. Do you support murder? By supporting,
   Santa Claus       worshiping, praising and promoting this murderous God, believers' normal moral
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   and legal inhibitors are erased. By legally accepting God's murders, all the
       Love          average believer needs is an excuse to murder. It is no wonder that 1 out of
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   about 130 US citizens are in the U. S. prison system for breaking one law or
 Visitor Comments    another.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
  Assorted Humor     Defense: Objection! Believers have to support and love God with all their heart
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   and soul no matter what God does! Believers have no right to murder unless God
     Samantha        or God's appointed authority over them orders them to kill to serve God's
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━   interests. Believers must conform to and obey God's laws - no matter what they
 Special Treats!     are.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   The DeVaney       Judge: Sustained. Prosecutor, you are again close to being held in contempt.

                     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     Bailiff: Court is back in session.

                     7. Exodus 14:6-28 God forced the Pharaoh and his army to chase the Jews. God
                     parted The Red Sea for Moses’ people. God collapsed the sea and murdered the
                     Pharaoh's Army who had followed the Jews into the sea.

                     Defense: Objection!

                     8. Exodus 21:15 God commanded: Whoever strikes his father or mother shall be
                     put to death. 

                     9. Exodus 21:17 & Leviticus 20:9 Whoever curses his father or mother shall be
                     murdered.

                     10. Exodus 21:20-21 If a man strikes his male or female slave and they die
                     immediately, the man shall be punished. But, if the slave lives a day or two
                     and then dies, the man will not be punished because that slave is his own
                     property. Catholic

                     Prosecutor: Judge, in my legal judgment, based on this Bible, C&V, the Biblical
                     God's documented sense of justice is corrupt. Aren't all the slaves in the
                     Bible and throughout history also God's children? How does God prove to love
                     them? God does not prove to love them. God does prove to have them suffer and
                     to kill them.

                     Judge: I am the judge here. I will decide what is to be judged. For the record,
                     God has no favorites. God is just and fair. So am I.

                     Prosecutor: But, your honor, what is just and fair about a slave dying after a
                     day or two of his master-inflicted injuries?

                     Judge: Enough! It is a dead issue. Move on.

                     11. Exodus 22:18 God directs to murder witches. KJV (Catholic version, it is in
                     Exodus 22:17)

                     P: I submit that the Biblical God is guilty of murders, throughout history, of
                     witches, psychics, and documented by name scientists.

                     12. Exodus 22:20 God commanded: If you sacrifice to any God other than the
                     Lord, you are to be murdered.

                     Prosecutor: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the Biblical God proves to be the
                     perfect model as the master of a master - slave relationship. I must ask the
                     jurors: Is this referring to the God you love, believe in, worship, promote,
                     support and finance? 

                     Defense: Objection. The prosecution is referring to the God I love!

                     Judge: Sustained. The prosecutor will refrain from defaming God.

                     13. Exodus 22:29 God said: Give Me the first-born of your sons.

                     Prosecutor: The Biblical God proves not to condone "Democracy". In a Democracy
                     - we elect our leaders to represent us - not to rule over us.

                     Defense: Objection! God is God. You have no vote with God!

                     Judge: Move on.

                     14. Exodus 22:30 A first-born animal may stay with its mother for 7 days, then
                     you must sacrifice it to Me.

                     Defense: That is out of context!

                     Prosecutor: Each Bible C&V has an importance and a context of its own. Combined
                     C&Vs may build more of a context and an importance - but rarely will the
                     combined context produce less of an importance. God already claimed the
                     firstborn of Humanity. This charge is the foundation for the next relevant
                     charge.

                     Judge: Sustained! I will decide the importance of these Bible C&Vs. You sir
                     will be careful concerning the C&Vs you select. You are close to being in
                     contempt.

                     Prosecutor: Acknowledged, your honor, but again, it is foundation for the next
                     relevant charge.

                     15. II Samuel 12:13-18 God murdered David and Bathsheba’s first-born son, a
                     human being, after 7 days of his life to punish the parents.

                     Prosecutor: Here is documented evidence that the Biblical God murdered an
                     innocent child for the sins of the parents. If you believe this Bible C&V
                     evidence, you must find its God guilty as charged.

                     Defense: Objection! God owns us and God can do what He wants to with us.

                     Judge: Sustained. (authoritatively) And, for the record ladies and gentlemen of
                     the jury, (schmoozing) God would never punish a child for the sins of the
                     parents. Anyone who would think so doesn't know their Bible. Besides, who knows
                     if that child was innocent? Now that I've handled that, the prosecutor will
                     proceed.

                     16. Exodus 23:22-32 God said: If you obey Me and do what I say, I will hate
                     your enemies and attack your foes. I will annihilate (murder) them. You will
                     serve your God.

                     Prosecutor: In Malachi 1:3 and Romans 9:13 God had said: I loved Jacob and I
                     hated Esau. This Bible C&V projects the Biblical God's character as one of
                     hating Human Beings. It is a far cry from the defense and some jurors claiming
                     this God to be a loving God. Does the defense and the jury need any more
                     evidence as to God’s admission and capacity for hating Human Beings?

                     Defense: Objection! Nonsense! God never hates. He is a loving God.

                     Judge: Move on.

                     17. Exodus 31:15 God commanded: Anyone who dares work on the Sabbath day shall
                     be murdered.

                     Prosecutor: This breaks 4th God's finger-written commandment. Has anyone in
                     this courtroom not done work on the Sabbath?

                     Defense: Objection! No one here is on trial - although the prosecutor should
                     be.

                     Judge: Granted. And, the suggestion is being considered. Proceed.

                     18. Exodus 32:27-28 Moses (Levi) ordered all the sons of Levi to slay their own
                     family, friends and neighbors; Moses murdered about 3,000 of their own
                     relatives.　

                     Prosecution: God ordered or allowed Moses to murder about 3,000 of "God’s own
                     chosen".

                     19. Exodus 35:2 God demands that we kill everyone who worked on the Sabbath
                     day.

                     Prosecutor: This confirms that God wants you dead if you work on the Sabbath.

                     Defense: Praise God!

                     Judge: Move on.

                     20. Leviticus 10:1-2 Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu offered incense to God, by
                     unauthorized fire. God murdered them both, by fire.

                     Defense: Objection! That was probably just an accident. But, God is entitled
                     and God does have the right to be worshiped the way He wants!

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     21. Leviticus 10:6 Bare your heads or tear your clothes and God will murder you
                     and bring His wrath on the whole community.

                     Prosecutor: Ladies and gentlemen, I submit to you a learned, educated,
                     well-known character witness. Richard Dawkins wrote: The God of the Old
                     testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and
                     proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive,
                     bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticide,
                     genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic,
                     capriciously malevolent bully.

                     Defense: Objection! No believer wants to hear Richard Dawkins, an Atheist, take
                     on our Holy Father.

                     Judge: Sustained!

                     22. Leviticus 15:31 Anyone unclean defiling Gods dwelling, God will murder.

                     (Side-note to reader: I select and expose Bible Chapters and Verses as they
                     depict the character and deeds of the Biblical God. Believers mostly react in
                     hostile, insulting and threatening manners as if they feel they are being
                     insulted and wronged. It is their Bible, and their God Who is being depicted by
                     their sacred Bible C&V source - isn’t it? Why do they feel insulted and wronged
                     when their own Bible C&V is accurately exposed? I did not write the Bible. I am
                     not responsible for what the Bible says. I am not responsible for how
                     "God-addicted-egos" feel about what the Bible says.)

                     23. Leviticus 20:9 God commands: Anyone who curses his father or mother shall
                     be put to death.

                     24. Leviticus 20:10 God commands: If you commit adultery, you shall be put to
                     death.

                     Prosecutor: Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, any Jewish Rabbi can be an expert
                     witness in the verification that in the Jewish Torah - what Christians call the
                     first 5 books of The Old Testament - there are 613 commandments. If you believe
                     that the Biblical God is real and if you have committed adultery, the Biblical
                     God commands that others murder you. How many of you believe that you are about
                     to die due to "God's word" concerning adultery? How many Christians
                     hypocritically "pick and choose" which of the 613 commandments to believe in,
                     promote, support and obey - and which to ignore?

                     Defense: Objection! Relevance?

                     Prosecutor: I hold these selected "truths" to be self-evident / relevance.

                     Defense: Objection! Opinion.

                     Judge: Sustained. I will choose and decide what is relevant and true in my
                     courtroom.

                     Prosecutor: Albert Einstein: "The world is a dangerous place to live; not
                     because of the people who are evil, but because of the people who don't do
                     anything about it."

                     Defense: Objection! Einstein's testimony has no relevance in this case.　

                     Judge: Sustained.　　

                     25. Leviticus 20:11 If a man has sex with his father's wife - uncovered his
                     father's nakedness - shall be put to death.

                     Prosecutor: Pastor Arnold Murray, a could-be Bible C&V expert witness, claims
                     that this is what Ham did to his father, Noah. Ham had sex with his father
                     Noah's wife, Ham's mother, and she bare Ham's son, Canaan. Noah did not curse
                     Ham but Noah did curse Canaan.

                     Defense: Objection! Ham, Noah's son, did uncover his father's nakedness by
                     having sex with Noah's wife, his mother - but, Ham was not murdered by God.

                     Judge: Sustained. (The judge rolled his eyes.) Defense approach the bench! (The
                     judge whispered): You moron! You validated the prosecutor's damaging point that
                     one who God chose to save from the flood then had sex with his father's wife,
                     his mother. Do not make me allow the prosecutor to make these damaging points.

                     Prosecutor: It is obvious, Judge, that the defense proves to know his Bible. As
                     the defense points out, God does not deal out blind justice. God does
                     discriminate and often does not murder His favorites.

                     Defense: Objection: It is believed that God has no favorites!

                     (The judge just sighs and remains silent.)

                     26. Leviticus 20:12 God commanded: If a man has sex with his daughter-in-law,
                     murder them both.

                     Defense: Objection! Judas impregnated Tamar, his daughter-in-law, and God did
                     not murder either one of them!

                     Judge: Sustained. (whispers to himself): Ah Jesus, help me.

                     Prosecutor: But, that's correct Judge! Tamar sold sex to her father-in-law,
                     Judah, and they, and their offspring, were in Jesus Christ's bloodline /
                     lineage.

                     Defense: Objection! Misinterpreted!

                     Judge: Over-ruled. I admonish the defense for bringing up Judah and Tamar. The
                     jury does not have to know these things. They are - ah - irreverent.

                     27. Leviticus 20:13 God commands to murder gay men.

                     Supporting Biblical Evidence: Romans 1:24-32 God let them do whatever shameful
                     things their hearts desired. They did vile and degrading things with each
                     other's bodies.  God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Women indulged
                     in sex with each other. Men who burn with lust for each other must suffer the
                     death penalty. 

                     Prosecutor: Gay marriage is now legal in the US. Having faith and belief in
                     murdering gay men is promoting evil while authoritatively calling it good - and
                     - denial is automatic.

                     Defense: Objection! Gay marriage is not yet legal in every state and should be
                     legal in none!

                     (The Judge shrugs in anger and silence.)

                     Prosecutor: Friedrich Nietzsche said: Faith means not wanting to know what is
                     true.

                     Defense: Objection! Irrelevant hearsay!

                     Judge: Move on.

                     28. Leviticus 20:14 God commanded: If a man marries a woman and her mother,
                     murder them by burning all three of them to death.

                     Prosecutor: Would you expect less from a God who would punish you for eternity
                     in the Hell he created - where you were fried, sizzled and burned forever?

                     Defense: God will send you to Hell - but not me - because God loves me!

                     Judge: Order in the court!

                     29. Leviticus 20:15 God commanded: If a man has sex with an animal, murder both
                     of them.

                     30. Leviticus 20:16 God commanded: Murder women who have sex with animals.

                     31. Leviticus 20:27 God commanded: If a man or woman acts as a fortuneteller,
                     murder them.

                     32. Leviticus 21:9 God commanded: A priest's daughter who fornicates - burn her
                     to death.

                     Defense: Objection! Satan is behind all evil!

                     Prosecutor: Robert M. Price asked: Who needs Satan when you have a God like
                     this?

                     Defense: Blasphemy!

                     Prosecutor: Albert Einstein said, "Morality is of the highest importance - but
                     for us - not for God."

                     Defense: Objection!

                     Judge: Sustained! I'll decide what's moral in my court.

                     33. Leviticus 21:17-21 God commanded: Any one with a handicap shall not profane
                     God’s sanctuary.

                     Defense: Objection! Irrelevant! Judge, the jury doesn't need to know God's
                     personal feelings toward the handicapped!

                     Judge: Sustained. (schmoozing / baby talk) The members of the jury are to
                     remember that God loves you very much - and so do I - if, you come to the
                     God-fearing verdict that holds commitment, mercy, righteousness, compassion and
                     that you accept God and love your God with all your heart.

                     Prosecutor: You honor, if you are not going to let the jury decide for itself,
                     why don't you dismiss the jury altogether?

                     Judge: How contemptible you are!

                     Prosecutor: Acknowledged, your honor.

                     34. Leviticus 22:9 God commands: Obey my rules or I will murder you.

                     Robert Ingersoll: There can be but little liberty on Earth while men worship a
                     tyrant in Heaven.

                     Prosecutor: Lew Paz's book Pushing Ultimate's states: Absolute power to reward
                     and punish does not make the Judeo-Christian God any more superior to other
                     gods, nor any more deserving of reverence, obedience, worship than any
                     tyrannical emperor or dictator.

                     Defense: Hearsay! No one can accuse God of being a tyrannical emperor or
                     dictator! Atheists like Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin were evil dictators.

                     Judge: (knowing and frustrated with the defense) Oh, my God!

                     Prosecutor: Being the defense brought up Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin - Adolf
                     Hitler was raised Catholic and sang in the church choir. Joseph Stalin attended
                     a religious seminary. Both men were evil and together were responsible for
                     about 50 million deaths. If the Biblical God placed them in authority, as the
                     Bible claims in Romans 13:1-7, their murderous behavior can be explained - as
                     they followed God's documented, murderous model.

                     (Dead silence.)

                     35. Leviticus 20:27 God ordered: A man or a woman who acts as a medium or
                     fortuneteller shall be stoned to death. 

                     36. Leviticus 24:10-16 God commanded: Anyone who blasphemes God’s name must be
                     stoned to death by the whole community.

                     37. Leviticus 24:11-16 An Israelite cursed and blasphemed God’s name. God
                     ordered: Take him outside the camp and let the whole community murder him.
                     Anyone who curses God shall be murdered.

                     Prosecutor: The Biblical God ordered a whole community to murder someone. So
                     much for "Thou shalt not kill".

                     Defense: Objection! It is blasphemy to use God's own words against Him.

                     Judge: (glaring at both the defense and the prosecution) Move on.

                     38. Leviticus 26:27-31 God stated: If you persist in disobeying and defying Me
                     (God), I will punish you until you begin to eat the flesh of your own sons and
                     daughters.

                     Prosecutor: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, based on your religious
                     upbringing, how do you now feel about these documented Bible C&V charges
                     against your Biblical God?

                     Defense: Objection! Asking for a conclusion.

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     39. Jeremiah: 19:9 God said: I will have them eat the flesh of their sons and
                     daughters; they shall eat one another’s flesh…

                     Defense: Objection! If God wants stupid people to eat their sons and daughters,
                     it is just, fair and correct - because He is God!

                     Prosecutor: Your honor! The defense fails to defend God, his client, other than
                     to say that He is God. The defense fails to articulate any other defense for
                     God.

                     Judge: (courtroom commotion / gavel) Order in the court. Move on.

                     40. Ezekiel 5:10 God said: Fathers shall eat sons and sons shall eat fathers.

                     Prosecutor: A simple question in reality - if the Biblical God made you eat the
                     flesh of your children, would you judge God to be "evil" or "a loving God"?

                     Defense: Objection! Calls for a ridiculous conclusion.

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     41. Numbers 1:51 & 3:10 God commanded: Any "stranger" (KJV) "layman" (Catholic
                     Version) who comes near God’s dwellings will be put to death.　

                     42. Judges 1:4 God delivered Judah the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their
                     hand and they slew 10,000 men.

                     43. Hosea 13:16 (KJV) or Hosea 14:1 (Catholic): Samaria, who rebelled against
                     God, will fall by the sword. The little ones shall be dashed to pieces,
                     expectant mothers shall be ripped open.

                     Prosecutor: The Bible has constantly depicted God to be angry, jealous,
                     selfish, wrathful and possessive. Think for a moment - Who in the entire Bible
                     was more miserable? But believers claim that this God is omnipotent and
                     knows-it-all. This obviously is false. The Biblical God did not know how to win
                     over Human Beings nor did this God know how to successfully manipulate them for
                     His pleasure. If God did know how to win Earth's people over for His pleasure,
                     He would have no excuse for not handling His murderous anger and jealousy.　

                     Defense: Objection! God does not need to make excuses - or to answer to man!
                     God is boss! We are nothing!

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     Prosecutor: Big deal. Boss over nothing.

                     Judge: One more wisecrack and you will again be in contempt.

                     44. Numbers 1:51 God said: Anyone else who goes too near the Tabernacle will be
                     executed.

                     Prosecutor: Can anyone explain this?

                     45. Numbers 3:13 God said: Every first-born of man and beast became Mine the
                     day I murdered all the first-born in Egypt. I am God.

                     Prosecutor: Could the Biblical God's murderous confession be any clearer?

                     Defense: Objection! An absurd misinterpretation!

                     46. Numbers 4:17-20 claims whom God would murder if they look at the sacred
                     objects.

                     47. Numbers 5:1-3 God moves all the sick, suffering people away from the camp,
                     as God can't stand to dwell near them.

                     Euripides stated: If the gods do what is shameful, they are not gods.

                     Prosecutor: Ladies and gentlemen, the human being has little conscience when it
                     comes to God. The constant, traditional threat of eternal torment has erased
                     the conscience of most gullible minds. If you fear your tormentor, you will not
                     judge Him. It's time to break that re-cycled hypnosis. It is an irrational
                     belief.

                     Defense: Objection! The prosecutor is delusional if he thinks he can judge
                     Almighty God and without that fear and belief, people would do what ever they
                     want.　

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     Prosecutor: Nonsense! Enforced civil and criminal law keeps sane people from
                     doing whatever they want that's illegal. If all children could be taught one
                     hour per week of law from first grade through grade 12, there would be no need
                     for religious threats and dogma.

                     Defense: Objection! If everyone knew the law, we lawyers couldn't make a
                     living.

                     Judge: (whispers) Idiot!

                     48. Numbers 11:1 The people complained, so God murdered many of them.

                     Defense: Sidebar, your honor! I've got a major complaint that I wish that you
                     or God would listen to right now.

                     Judge: Sidebar! (angrily whispering to the prosecutor) I'm tired of warning
                     you. Tread lightly or you will face my wrath! If God doesn't get you - I will.

                     Defense: You tell him, Judge!

                     49. Numbers 11:18-20 God made them eat meat until it came out of their noses.
                     They died.

                     Prosecutor: Concerning all of God’s murdering, documented by the Bible C&V, how
                     many believers are totally ignorant, brain-washed and mind-set concerning the
                     distinction between good　and evil / rightand wrong? If God did something
                     damaging to someone that you would not want done to you, it was probably evil
                     and wrong. You do not have to be the victim to judge something to be wrong.

                     Defense: Objection! It is not the jury's business to judge the deeds of God? If
                     God does something - it is perfect!

                     Prosecutor: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you must ask yourself: Is the
                     Biblical God moral, just and legally correct in murdering each and every one of
                     these Human Beings? Again, ask yourself: Would I personally murder or have
                     murdered all of these Human Beings?

                     Defense (frustrated): Objection. I’ll answer for the jury. Yes! If I was God I
                     would murder all those God Dammed Human Beings.

                     Prosecutor: Why?

                     Defense: Because God did it and God can’t be wrong!

                     Prosecutor: Can we have a recess, your honor?

                     Judge: The court will reconvene in one hour. (Gavel)

                     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     Bailiff: All rise. Court is reconvened.

                     Judge: (gavel) Continue.

                     50. Numbers 14:2-23 God said to Moses: How long will this nation continue to
                     provoke me? I will murder them! I will murder all the people who saw what I did
                     in Egypt and in the desert, but who still don't obey.

                     Prosecutor: Is there any doubt that the Bible is vicious with a vicious,
                     murderous God?

                     Defense: Objection! Again, where is your proof?

                     Prosecutor: These selected Bible C&Vs are your evidence, your proof.

                     Judge: Continue.

                     51. Numbers 14:26-38 God spoke to Moses and Aaron: You will not get to The
                     Promised Land. Everyone, over twenty years old, who was counted is going to die
                     in the desert. The only exceptions will be Caleb and Joshua. Your corpses will
                     fall in the desert. They will die.

                     52. Numbers 14:36-38 Men who explored and gave a bad report about The Promised
                     Land were murdered immediately. Only Joshua and Caleb remained alive.

                     Prosecutor: Is the real religious hypocrisy the believers attempt to separate
                     his or her God from the programmed deeds or the God of the Bible? Do you now
                     proclaim that the Biblical God - who is documented to have done these insane,
                     murderous deeds - is your God?

                     Defense: Objection! The prosecutor is attempting to brain-wash the jury!

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     53. Sirach: 46:7-8 Caleb and Joshua were the only two (2) spared out of the
                     600,000 infantry. Catholic

                     Numbers 1:45-46 The total number of men 20-years-old and up able to fight war
                     was 603,550. KJV

                     Prosecutor: Out of the 603,550 soldiers that left Egypt, nobody over 20 made it
                     to "The Promised Land". Caleb and Joshua do get to "The Promised Land". Yes,
                     but only after they steal,　torture, mutilate, and slaughter the current
                     inhabitant owners and their babies for the land. Ladies and gentlemen of the
                     jury, the Biblical God murdered all who God took out of Egypt over 20-years-old
                     except for Joshua and Caleb.

                     The Torah Notes state: It was estimated that it would require a population of
                     about three (3) million people to produce 600,000 + men to soldier over
                     20-years-old. Again, ladies and gentlemen of the jury - according to these
                     Bible C&Vs and notes, God Himself, ended up killing most of His "chosen people"
                     that He took out of Egypt - except for Caleb and Joshua. According to Torah
                     notes - that is about 3 million people. If so, God murdered most of His "chosen
                     people"! Except for living in hopeless fear, how can anyone sane support this
                     insane God / character?

                     Defense: Objection! Judge, I'm going to have a heart attack!

                     Prosecutor (ignoring the drama): Remember, murder takes places when one takes
                     the life of a Human Being to fulfill one’s personal agenda.

                     Defense: (screams) I've got a murder agenda for you!!!

                     Judge: Bailiff, restrain the defense... I'll warn the prosecution yet again,
                     proceed with caution.

                     54. Numbers 15:32-36 They found a man gathering sticks on The Sabbath Day. God
                     commanded Moses to have the whole congregation murder the man.

                     Prosecution: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, do you or members of your family
                     ever work on the Sabbath? Do you view that God's punishment fits the crime?

                     55. Numbers 16:1-35 Korah and 250 Israelite leaders stood up to Moses. Dathan
                     and Abriam disobeyed Moses. God opened up the ground and sent Dathan, Abiram,
                     their wives, sons and babies down to the nether world. God then, burned alive,
                     by fire, Korah’s 250 men, who had made an offering to God.

                     56. Numbers 17:6-14 Then the whole Israelite community complained against Moses
                     and Aaron. God appeared and said to Moses: Depart, that I may consume (murder)
                     them at once. God murdered 14,700 more of His Own "chosen".

                     (The 14,700 deaths are in the Catholic version only. In the KJV, there is no
                     Numbers 17:14 as the KJV stops at C&V 17:13. There are not many differences
                     between the KJV and the Catholic version - but, this is one specific
                     difference.)

                     Prosecutor: Based on the documented evidence in the Catholic version, I charge
                     God with murdering 14,700 people just for complaining.

                     Judge: Prosecutor, you had best repent for your absurd charges.

                     Prosecutor: Why should I repent for my prosecution of a "God / Character", real
                     or fictional, who is documented to have done many times more evil than anyone
                     else in the entire Bible?

                     Judge: Be warned, prosecutor! I have had enough of you for today. Court will
                     re-convene at 10 AM tomorrow morning.

                     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     Bailiff: All rise. This court is now in session.

                     Judge: Resume.

                     Prosecutor: Good morning ladies and gentlemen.

                     57. Numbers 18:7&22 God ordered: Any layman coming near the alter will deserve
                     death / murder.

                     Prosecutor: Insanity is a legal term that, through behavior, exposes those who
                     are incapable of distinguishing good from bad / right from wrong. If you and I
                     are legally sane, then we can determine if the Biblical God is good or evil by
                     these selected C&V deeds.

                     58. Numbers 21:5-6 The people spoke out against God and Moses. God sent
                     poisonous snakes against his people. They were bitten and they died.

                     Prosecutor: The Biblical God sent poisonous snakes to kill His "chosen people"
                     in the desert. God ordered Moses to make a "caduceus" - a snake wrapped around
                     a pole - so all seeing it would not die of snake-bite. The Bible proves to be a
                     violent book that depicts its God to be a violent, murderous character.

                     Defense: Objection! Where is your proof?

                     Prosecutor: Don't these selected Bible C&Vs serve as documented proof? You do
                     believe those C&Vs - don't you?

                     Judge: Continue.

                     59. Amos 9:3 God said: Though they hide from My sight in the bottom of the sea,
                     I command the serpent and he shall bite them.

                     Prosecutor: If someone, on trial, put poisonous snakes in a room full of
                     children - and many of them died - would you judge that someone to be guilty of
                     murder?

                     Defense: Objection! The prosecutor is being dramatic to stir human emotions.
                     This is God we are talking about - not just "someone". If God wants to take
                     some of His children to Heaven, that's God's right.

                     Judge: Continue.

                     60. Numbers 21:33-35 God ordered Moses to do to the King of Og as he had done
                     to others. Moses struck down the King's sons and all of his people until none
                     were left and Moses took possession of the King's land.

                     Prosecutor: Any God who is documented and judged accurately to have slaughtered
                     men, women and children to fulfill his personal agendas is criminally insane
                     and evil. By documented Bible C&V evidence, this God is definitely guilty of
                     the murder of men, women and children. Why would any sane Human Being worship,
                     praise, serve, support, promote and finance such a God - fictional or real?
                     Reflect, is your personal God this insane, murderous Biblical God?

                     61. Numbers 22:33-35 God said: Had your ass not turned away, I would have
                     murdered you; but I would have spared your ass.

                     Prosecutor: The Biblical God confessed a situation whereby God would have
                     murdered.

                     62. Numbers 25:4 God said to Moses: Take all the heads of the people and hang
                     them up before the Lord against the sun, that the fierce anger of the Lord may
                     be turned away from Israel.

                     Prosecutor: The Biblical God ordered Moses to hang Human heads in the sun so
                     this psychopathic God would turn away His anger from His “chosen” Israel.  

                     63. Numbers 25:6-9 Phinehas (KJV) or Pinchas (Torah), a grandson of Aaron the
                     priest, taking a lance in hand, drove the lance through both the man's and the
                     woman's groin, murdering them both. That pleased God, so, God stopped His
                     murdering men women and children after He had murdered 24,000 more of “His Own
                     chosen Hebrews".

                     Prosecutor: I charge the Biblical God with murdering 24,000 more Human Beings
                     just because two people got married without God's consent.

                     64. Numbers 25:16-17 God ordered Moses: Treat the Midianites as enemies. Crush
                     them.

                     Prosecutor: If you believe Bible C&V, this is documented evidence that the
                     Biblical God ordered Moses to murder Midianites - a tribe of Human Beings.

                     Defense: I object! Judge, please stop the prosecutor from demonizing the God I
                     love!

                     Judge: Sustained! For the record, the prosecutor is again admonished.　

                     65. Numbers 31:7-34 God declared war on Midian, murdered every male including
                     its 5 kings, kept 32,000 virgins, then ordered Moses to execute thousands of
                     others including mothers and babies.

                     Numbers 31:17 God specifically ordered: Kill every male among the little ones
                     and kill every woman that has had sex with a man. 

                     Prosecutor: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I can only offer Bible C&V
                     documentation as evidence. To disbelieve this evidence is to disbelieve the
                     Bible.

                     Defense: (screaming) Objection! There is no evidence! This is a demon devised
                     witch-hunt and the prosecutor proves to be the Devil's disciple!　　

                     Judge: (whispers: Jesus Help me.) Proceed. 　　

                     66. Numbers 32:11-13 God said: Because the Israelites didn't wholly follow Me
                     (didn’t want to kill and die for any more land) God displayed anger against
                     Israel. God made them wander for 40 years in the desert until they all died
                     out.

                     Prosecutor: This is evidence that the Biblical God is an insane, psychopathic
                     killer - even of His own "chosen" Israelites. What does it take for a juror -
                     even if he or she is a believer - to see a psychopathic killer?

                     Defense: (exhausted groan.)

                     Prosecutor: Is the Biblical God a psychopathic killer - purely for the love of
                     killing - or did God murder all of His victims simply to fulfill His personal,
                     control-crazy agendas?

                     Defense: Objection! The prosecution only offered two god-damning choices.

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     67. Numbers 33:4 The Egyptians buried their first-born that God had murdered.

                     68. Numbers 33:55-56 God said: If you do not drive out the inhabitants of the
                     land, I will do to you what I thought to do to them. KJV

                     Defense: Objection! I don' like it when you speak of God in these hurtful
                     tones. God is not evil!

                     Prosecutor: Yes! By definition - God is evil! God has murdered all these Human
                     Beings by Bible C&V evidence. Isn't God saying here: You murder them or I will
                     murder you? God's murders are evil and premediated. Like any terrorist, the
                     Biblical God promotes and strives on fear.

                     Defense: Objection! Misinterpreted!

                     Judge: Moving on...

                     69. Deuteronomy 2:14-15 Thirty-eight (38) years later, God had destroyed,
                     murdered and consumed the whole generation of soldiers.

                     Prosecutor: This all-knowing, all-powerful Biblical God destroyed a whole
                     generation of His own soldiers. Other than being evil, why would the Biblical
                     God do that?

                     Defense: Objection! God is God and can do whatever He wants! The prosecutor is
                     the only one in this courtroom who cannot see the big picture.

                     Judge: Sustained. The prosecutor had best not infer that God is anything but
                     good, righteous and just.

                     70. Deuteronomy 2:24-25 God said to His chosen: Begin the murdering occupation.
                     Provoke him into war. Today, I am beginning to make all nations dread and fear
                     you.

                     Prosecution: The Biblical God is a tyrant who promotes war and orders fearful
                     terrorism.

                     Defense: (weakly) Objection. God does nice things for those He loves. 　

                     71. Deuteronomy 2:30-34 God made stubborn and obstinate of heart King Sihon so
                     we could murder him, his sons and all his people. God’s army destroyed all this
                     King’s cities and utterly destroyed all the men, women, and murdered all the
                     little ones. God left no survivor.

                     Prosecutor: God's will used a human army to murder men, women and all their
                     little ones. God left no survivor.

                     72. Deuteronomy 3:1-6 God delivered Og to us and we killed until none remained,
                     utterly destroying all the men, women and children of all 60 cities.

                     Prosecutor: Like O. J. Simpson, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, a hero, who
                     had many fine performances, can be destroyed by just one bad act. How many bad,
                     murderous and insane acts did the Biblical God do?

                     Defense: Objection! O. J. is in not on trial here.

                     Judge: Sustained. Get your facts straight, counselor. Mr. O. J. Simpson was
                     destroyed by more than one bad act.

                     Prosecutor: Thanks for the acknowledgment, your honor.

                     Judge: (gavel!) That was no acknowledgment! It was the straightening out of a
                     technical point that the man had been charged with two murder crimes! Let the
                     jury be reminded that - concerning Mr. O. J. Simpson's two murder crimes - O.
                     J. was acquitted! Concerning the O. J. Simpson murder trial, I do not want the
                     innocent judged to be guilty in my courtroom.

                     Prosecutor: Your honor, O. J. Simpson was NOT tried by a jury of his peers. O.
                     J. was tried by a jury of his fans. I am concerned with what is happening here.
                     Your honor, your guiding comments to the jury may be grounds for a mistrial.　

                     Judge: (gavel!) Silence! Both counsels will meet with me in my chambers.　

                     (The Judge's rage was more mind-set believer to Atheist ass-reaming and typical
                     "eternal- torment" threats.)

                     (Later - The prosecution continues:)　

                     73. Deuteronomy 4:21-22 Moses said: God displayed anger at me due to your
                     words. God swore I would die in this country - not making it into The Promised
                     Land.

                     Prosecutor: God also broke His promise to Moses. God took Moses', Aaron's and
                     Miriam's lives before the three of them could get into God's human,
                     blood-soaked "Promised Land".

                     Defense: Objection. Miriam did not count in those days - because she was a
                     woman.

                     Judge: Over-ruled. It is common, accepted knowledge that God takes whoever's
                     life God wants to just because God chooses to do so. No one knows the "perfect
                     and just" mind of God.

                     74. Deuteronomy 4:25-26 God commanded: If you make a statue or image, making
                     God angry, you will then be utterly destroyed.

                     Prosecutor: The Biblical God was hypocritical about graven-images because after
                     God sent poisonous snakes to kill His chosen people in the desert, God ordered
                     Moses to make a "caduceus" - a snake wrapped around a pole - so all seeing it
                     would not die of snake-bite. God had also ordered to be built "The
                     Arc-Of-The-Covenant". If those two items do not qualify as "graven-images" -
                     what does? And, why is the Catholic Church (among others) so full of
                     graven-images?

                     75. Deuteronomy 7:16 Without pity, murder all the people who God delivers to
                     you.

                     Prosecutor: God redundantly ordered and got bloody, no-prisoner war. Whatever
                     the Biblical God’s mental / emotional condition is or whatever His murderous
                     motives are, the Bible exposes and documents, C&V, all of "The God Murders". If
                     you are thinking, are you starting to realize that the Biblical God often
                     proves to be a cruel, remorseless murderer?

                     Defense (jumping up): But, God is good when we obey Him!

                     Judge: Sit down!

                     76. Deuteronomy 7:20-24 God will send hornets to destroy your surviving
                     enemies. You will take these nations little by little; you cannot exterminate
                     them all at once. You will rout them utterly until they are annihilated. No man
                     will be able to stand against you, till you put an end by murdering them.

                     77. Deuteronomy 8:20 Like the nations God destroys before you, so shall you too
                     perish and be murdered, if you do not obey God.

                     Jean-Paul Sarte said: I hate victims who respect their executioners.

                     Defense: Objection! Sartre is an Atheist whose testimony - this court does not
                     need.

                     Judge: Sustained. The jury will disregard Sartre.

                     78. Deuteronomy 9:3 God, a consuming fire, will reduce them to nothing and
                     subdue them before you, so that you can drive them out / destroy / murder them
                     quickly.

                     Prosecutor: If God is a "consuming fire" what is Hell?

                     Defense: Blasphemy!

                     79.  Deuteronomy 17:12 God commanded: Anyone arrogant enough to reject the
                     verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents God must be put to death.
                      

                     Defense: And let that be a warning to you mister arrogant prosecutor.

                     80. Deuteronomy 20:10-14 The Biblical God ordered: When you come to a city to
                     war against, first proclaim peace to it and all the people found there shall
                     serve you. If the city will not make peace with you, but will make war against
                     you, then you shall murder them make them surrender to you. When your God has
                     delivered the city into your hands, you shall then murder every male with the
                     edge of the sword. But, the women, the little ones, the cattle, and all that is
                     in the city, you shall take for yourself. You shall eat the spoils of your
                     enemies that your God has given you.

                     Prosecutor: This Biblical God is the mentality of murder and war.

                     Defense: More blasphemy!

                     81. Deuteronomy 12:2 God said: You shall destroy / murder places God chooses.

                     Prosecutor: The Biblical God scores at the top of the scale of psychopathic
                     behavior.

                     Defense: Objection! There is no such scale!

                     Judge: Sustained. The jury will disregard any such scale - not in evidence.

                     Prosecutor: The Bible best serves as a scale for psychopathic behavior.

                     Defense: Objection!　

                     82. Deuteronomy 13:1-5 God said: Prophets among you who say: Come, let us
                     worship the gods of foreign nations, do not listen to them. God is testing you
                     to see if you love him with all your heart and soul.  Serve only God and fear
                     him alone.  Obey his commands. False prophets who try to lead you astray must
                     be put to death. You must execute them.  God commanded: Anyone who dreams or
                     prophesizes anything that is against God, or anyone who tries to turn you from
                     God, is to be put to death.

                     Defense: Our God is a jealous God, your honor.

                     83. Deuteronomy 13:6–10 God ordered: If your brother, son, daughter, wife or
                     friend entices you secretly to serve other Gods - murder them. Your hand shall
                     be the first raised to kill them. The rest of the people shall join in killing
                     them with you.

                     Prosecutor: The Biblical God commanded: If your daughter said: Let’s serve
                     other gods - you shall murder her. You are to get everybody to help you kill
                     her. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, The Biblical God demands right here that
                     you are to murder members of your family if they do not serve this fanatically
                     jealous and tyrannical God. Furthermore, this murderous God commands that
                     everyone is to join in and also become murderers. Who remembers: "Thou Shalt
                     Not Kill"? The Biblical God distinctly orders others to join in on the
                     murdering! Does God want vigilantes? This is one example whereby the Biblical
                     God documented His command to murder one's family members. Islam calls it
                     "Honor Killing". Under US criminal law - it is called murder.

                     Defense: Objection! Islam is an evil, false religion! How dare the prosecutor
                     mention it on this court.

                     Judge: The jury will disregard Islam.

                     84. Deuteronomy 13:13-19 If a town God is giving you eads you to worship
                     foreign gods, you must attack that town and completely destroy all its
                     inhabitants and livestock. Then, pile all the plunder in the middle of the
                     street and burn it as a burnt offering to God. God will only be merciful if you
                     obey and keep all of God’s commands. 

                     Prosecutor: Is it any wonder that hypnotized believers become frightened when
                     someone speaks out against this monstrous God?

                     Defense: Hypnotized? Objection! Irrelevant!

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     85. Deuteronomy 17:2–7 Kill anyone with a different religion. Stone them with
                     stones, until they die. The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to
                     put him to death, and afterward stoned by the hands of all the people.

                     Defense: Objection! Believers are not vigilantes - although - I am confident
                     that in the prosecutor's case - we'd like to be.

                     Judge: (sadly) Over-ruled.

                     Prosecutor: It seems that man has altered God’s 10 commandments. "Thou Shalt
                     Not Kill" obviously came from "Thou Shalt Not Kill - Except On My Terms." Due
                     to all of God’s, chapter and verse, commands to murder and to steal, some of
                     this Biblical God’s 10 main
                     commandments must have been altered and edited.

                     "The God of the Bible is NOT a good God and the Bible is NOT a good model for
                     humanity." It is time to retire this heinous God and the corrupt religious and
                     political Bible that humanity has painfully followed and fearfully promoted.

                     Defense: Objection! The prosecutor is forming a conclusion!

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     Prosecutor: Judge, we have formed a conclusion or we would not be prosecuting.

                     (No response.)

                     86. Deuteronomy 17:7 God said: At an execution, the witnesses are the first to
                     kill the condemned; then, all the people are to join in murdering him or her.
                     Catholic

                     Prosecutor: Again, God orders all the people to become a mob of murders.

                     87. Deuteronomy 17:12 God commanded: Any man who has the insolence to refuse to
                     listen to God’s priest or Judges shall be murdered.

                     Prosecutor: Judge, we now understand your sense of control, power and
                     authority.

                     Judge: Sir, I am getting sick and tired and totally fed-up with your arrogance.

                     88. Deuteronomy 18:20-22 God demanded: Any prophet who claims to give a message
                     from another god or who falsely claims to speak for Me must die. 

                     89. Deuteronomy 20:10-17 God said: When you attack a city, first offer it terms
                     of peace. If it agrees, all of its people will serve you in forced labor. If
                     they refuse, destroy them by murdering all their males; but, the women,
                     children, livestock worth plundering, God has given to you. That is how you
                     deal with a distant city. But, the cities God gives you as your heritage, you
                     shall not leave a single soul alive. You must doom and murder them all.

                     Prosecutor: What does "you shall not leave a single soul alive" mean? Don't
                     human souls live forever - or does God want selected souls dead?

                     Defense: Irrelevant questions based on bias hearsay.

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     90. Deuteronomy 21:18-21 God commanded: If a father has a stubborn, rebellious
                     son, murder the boy.

                     Prosecutor: This insane command is what you can expect from a "father" who
                     planned, arranged and carried out the torture and crucifixion of His "Only
                     Begotten Son".

                     (The defense and the Judge are tense - yet remain quiet.)

                     91. Deuteronomy 22:20-21 God ordered: If a woman wasn't a virgin on her wedding
                     night, they shall bring the girl to the entrance of her father’s house and
                     there her townsman shall stone her to death. 

                     Prosecutor: Members of the jury, if your young daughter proved not to be a
                     virgin, would you have her murdered? No wonder, if He were a knowledgeable man,
                     Jesus Christ remained a virgin and didn't have children - or did He?

                     Defense: Objection! Jesus Christ was all man - a virgin man - and Jesus did not
                     have children - dammit!

                     Judge whispers to himself: "Eli Eli Lamasabachne!" ("My God, My God, why hast
                     thou forsaken me.")

                     92. Deuteronomy 22:22 God commanded: If a man has relations (sex) with a
                     married woman, murder them both.

                     Prosecutor: Did your God create you to yield to love and lust - and then
                     condemn you for it?

                     Defense: Objection! One's personal relationship with God is private and no one
                     else's business.

                     Prosecutor: Then, why do practicing Christian believers push their God on
                     others?

                     Judge: Proceed.

                     93. Deuteronomy 22:23 God commanded: If a man has sex with a betrothed virgin,
                     murder them both: She, because she didn’t cry out; he, because he humbled his
                     neighbor’s wife.

                     Prosecutor: Here the Biblical God demands murder under illogical circumstances.
                     Why would God demand that the virgin die if she could not cry out? And, what
                     "virgin" could be his neighbor's wife. Under law, she would have to lose her
                     virginity through intercourse with her new husband to consummate their legal
                     marriage.

                     Defense: Scripture is sacred. You are to believe it!

                     94. Malachi 3:16-19 A record book was written of those who fear Him and trust
                     His name. God said: You shall see the distinction between the just and the
                     wicked between who serves and doesn’t serve God. The day is coming that all the
                     proud and all evildoers will be set on fire and murdered.

                     The Notorious Deuteronomy Chapter 28

                     If you do not obey God - these things will happen to you:

                     95. Deuteronomy 28:20 God will defeat / frustrate every enterprise you
                     undertake until you are speedily murdered, destroyed and perish.

                     96. Deuteronomy 28:21 God will make disease attach to you until you are
                     consumed / murdered.

                     97. Deuteronomy 28:22 God shall murder you with consumption, inflammation,
                     fever, extreme burning, with the sword, with blasting　and with mildew until
                     you die. KJV　

                     98. Deuteronomy 28:24 God will make your land powder and dust until you die.

                     99. Deuteronomy 28:25 God will cause your enemies to murder you.

                     100. Deuteronomy 28:51 God said: They will eat your animals and crops until you
                     are destroyed.

                     101. Deuteronomy 28:53-55 You will eat the fruit of your womb, the flesh of
                     your own sons and daughters while begrudging your relatives any share of your
                     children that you, yourself are using for food.

                     102. Deuteronomy 28:56-57 God said: The most refined and delicate woman will
                     refuse her husband and children her afterbirth and her infant, that comes out
                     from between her legs, as she secretly eats them for food.

                     Prosecutor: If you don't obey the Biblical God, He will make you secretly eat
                     your child? Could you acquit your God for doing this to you and your infant?
                     Can you visualize the monster of monsters within the pages of the Bible?

                     Defense: Objection! Blasphemy!

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     103. Deuteronomy 32:42 God said: I will make my arrows drunk with blood, my
                     sword shall gorge itself with flesh with the blood of the slain and captured,
                     flesh from the murdered heads of the enemy leaders.

                     Finis: Deuteronomy Chapter 28...

                     104. Joshua 5:6 The Israelites wandered 40 years in the desert until all the
                     warriors that came out of Egypt died off because they had not obeyed the
                     command of God. God swore that He would not let them see the land of milk and
                     honey that God promised their fathers He would give them. The Hebrews fled
                     Egypt to escape Egyptian tyranny. God promised them "The Promised Land". By
                     leaving, they became subjected to God’s tyranny. Because they would not obey
                     God’s orders to murder all the men, women and children in "The Promised Land"
                     in order to occupy it, God wanted them dead. God murdered / destroyed them.

                     105. Joshua 6:20-21 God ordered Joshua to attack Jericho’s mighty walled city.
                     God knocked the walls down with sound. Joshua’s army slaughtered all the men,
                     women, young and old.　　

                     Prosecutor: What sane reason did the Biblical God have to brutally exterminate
                     all of these Human Beings. They are all supposed to be God's children, aren’t
                     they?

                     Defense (jumps up): No! God is going to send them all to Hell! Praise God!

                     The judge just stares at the defense - then closes his eyes.

                     106. Joshua 6:23-25 The "harlot" (hooker / prostitute), Rahab, and her family
                     were spared by the spies. They burned the city and everything in it except for
                     the silver and gold, which was placed in the treasury in the house of God.

                     Prosecutor: Rahab-The-Harlot married the Israelite Pirest, Salmon, was King
                     David's great-grandmother and showed up in Jesus Christ's lineage / bloodline.

                     Defense: Objection! How dare you infer that Jesus Christ had a harlot in His
                     pure, sacred bloodline!

                     Judge: Mumbling and shaking.

                     107. Joshua 7:19-25 A’chen took some spoils of war against God’s ban. God gets
                     mad. Then, the Israelites lose a battle. Thousands of Israeli soldiers are
                     killed. Israel stoned and burned A’chan and his children.

                     108. Joshua 8:1-2 God tells Joshua to get his army and to go murder the city of
                     A’i; to do to the A’i King what they did to Jericho and its King, except that
                     they may take its spoils and livestock as booty.

                     109. Joshua 8:8 God said to Joshua: When you have taken the city, set it on
                     fire in obedience to God’ command. These are My orders to you.

                     110. Joshua 8:9 & 24-29 (by ambush) God murders all 12,000 men and women, the
                     entire population of A’i. Joshua hanged their King.

                     Judge: Enough! Court will re-convene at 10 AM tomorrow morning.

                     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     Overnight an alternate juror replaced a juror who had cried out: I cannot judge
                     God because I serve God.

                     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                     Bailiff: Court is now in session.

                     Judge: Resume.

                     Prosecutor: Good morning Judge and ladies and gentlemen.

                     111. Joshua 10:10-11 God slew a great slaughter at Gideon and other cities.
                     When the victims fled, God cast down great stones from Heaven. More died by
                     God’s hailstones than the Israeli soldiers killed by sword.

                     Defense: God has the perfect right to exterminate anyone He chooses.

                     Prosecutor: Then, you admit that God murdered all these people.

                     Defense: No! If God does it - it is not murder!

                     Prosecutor: You are a lawyer, sir and you know what murder is.

                     Defense: (whispers) Go to hell.

                     112. Joshua 10:12-13 Joshua ordered God to make the Sun and the Moon stand
                     still so Joshua could finish God’ murdering. God obeyed the voice of a man.

                     113. Joshua 10:22-26 The five kings remained alive Prisoners Of War. Joshua
                     said: Put your foot on their necks. Do not be afraid, be firm. Joshua struck
                     and murdered them. He hanged the 5 Kings (P.O.W.s) on 5 trees.

                     Defense: Objection! Those evil Kings were just in the way of God's "Promised
                     Land" agenda. Again, it is all God's land to give to whom God chooses.

                     114. Joshua 10:28-42 Joshua captured and God slaughtered the cities: Makkedah,
                     Libnah, Lachish, Gezer, Eglon, Hebron, and Debir and murdered every person
                     leaving no survivors, not even their Kings.

                     Defense: Objection! Joshua did the slaughtering - not God!

                     Prosecutor: The Biblical God targeted the murdered people - so God is guilty.

                     115. Joshua 11:20 God hardened the hearts of the people God wanted killed for
                     their land. God made them war with the Israelites so that God could kill them.
                     　

                     Defense: Objection! You might condemn God's actions but you cannot condemn God!

                     Everyone paused in silent bewilderment.

                     Prosecutor: Well, that is absolutely true - unless it isn't.

                     Someone laughed. The Judge used his gavel and shouted: Order in the court!

                     116. Joshua 12:7-24 Joshua captured and murdered over 30 countries and their
                     Kings.

                     117. Joshua 24:5 God boasted: Then I, God, sent Moses and Aaron and murdered
                     Egypt.

                     Prosecutor: If the Bible is to be believed at all, doesn't this Bible C&V serve
                     as God's documented confession?

                     Defense: Objection! God did not write the Bible. So no - that C&V does not
                     serve as God's confession.

                     Prosecutor: Then, was the Bible “God inspired”? What is your ruling, Judge?

                     Judge: (sigh) For the purpose and consequence of this trial, I declare that not
                     all of the Bible was God inspired.

                     118. Joshua 24:7-14 God said: After you witnessed what I did in Egypt, you
                     dwelt in the desert for a long time. I brought you to this land and I destroyed
                     it before you. I sent hornets ahead of you and drove them out of your way. It
                     was not your sword or bow. I gave you land that you did not till and cities you
                     did not build. Therefore, fear God, obey, and serve Him completely and
                     sincerely.

                     Prosecutor: God admitted here to murder people and to steal their land for His
                     chosen people. God murdered, stole and gave them land that they were not
                     entitled to.

                     Defense: (weakly going through the motions): Objection. Ah, Out of context?

                     119. Judges 1:4-6 God slew 10,000 and cut off Adonibek’s thumbs and big toes.

                     120. Judges 3:31 Shamgar (God’s savior) slew 600 Philistines.

                     121. Judges 8:10 God murdered 120,000 men that drew sword.

                     Prosecutor: Are you numb as to numbers that God has murdered yet?

                     Defense: Objection. Leading the jury.

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     122. Judges 9:1-5 Abimelech, God’s chosen, murdered his 70 brothers.

                     Prosecutor: As documented, Abimelech is the type of murderous character that
                     the Biblical God chooses to fulfill His agendas?

                     123. Judges 10:7 The anger of God was hot against Israel and God sold them out.

                     Prosecutor: Here is documented proof of God selling out His "chosen" people.
                     What a loyal, loving God!

                     124. Judges 11:30-39 God had Jephthah murder 20 cities for Him. Then, God had
                     Jephthah’s 13-year-old daughter first to come through his door, to happily
                     welcome her father home. Jephthah gave his virgin daughter 2 months to mourn
                     her virginity in that she couldn’t live long enough to bear children. Jephthah
                     then sacrificed his only child by burnt-offering to the Biblical God.

                     Prosecutor: Robert Ingersoll has documented: "It is impossible for me to
                     conceive of a character more utterly detestable than that of the Hebrew god."
                     Ingersoll's Works: Vol. 2, p. 237

                     Defense: Objection! Atheist hearsay.

                     Judge: Sustained! I will not let your expert witness testify against God. The
                     jury will disregard that atheist, that heathen, that sinning low-life, Robert
                     Ingersoll.

                     125. Judges 13:1 The Israelites again offended God. God sold the Israelites out
                     to the Philistines for 40 years.

                     Prosecutor: Here is another documented example of the Biblical God "selling
                     out" His own chosen people. Did the know-it-all Biblical God make documented
                     errors in His choice?

                     126. Judges 14:1-4 Samson saw a Philistine woman that orchestrated God’s plan
                     to go against the Philistines. God had Samson be born and become a weapon to
                     destroy and murder the Philistines.

                     Prosecutor: This Bible C&V evidence documents the Biblical God’s motive, means
                     and intent to murder selected Human Beings.

                     127. Judges 14:11-20 Samson bet 30 men 30 tunics to solve a riddle. Upon losing
                     the bet, the Spirit of God inspired Samson to murder 30 men in town for their
                     tunics to pay the debt off. Samson’s wife, who had just married Samson, made
                     him lose the bet. Then, she married Samson’s best man.

                     Prosecutor: It is hereby documented by Bible C&V that the Spirit of God
                     inspired Samson to murder 30 innocent, Human men so Samson could steal their
                     tunics. Do the jurors sense God’s guilt by inspiring Samson to murder and steal
                     from these men?

                     Defense: Objection: God has the right to do what He does. How dare you take
                     issue with Almighty God!

                     Prosecutor: The defense admits to God’s guilt, your honor.

                     Judge: Side-bar! You two are totally pissing me off. Now, stop making it
                     difficult for this court and carefully do your job. (addressing the jury): The
                     jury will disregard the defense’s comment. (some jurors looked relieved.)

                     128. Judges 15:15-16 God released Samson’s hands; he found a jawbone of an ass
                     and killed / murdered 1,000 men. Samson said: With the jawbone of an ass, I
                     have slain a thousand men.

                     Prosecutor: The Biblical God released Samson’s hands so Samson could kill 1,000
                     men.

                     129. Judges 16:29-30 Samson killed more men and women bringing down the temple
                     than he had murdered during his entire lifetime, and died himself.

                     Prosecutor: God created Samson to murder all the Human Beings documented by
                     this Bible C&V evidence. The Biblical God proves to be guilty of motive, intent
                     and the actual murdering of these - more than 2,000 - Human Beings.

                     130. Judges 18:27 They attacked Laish, a quiet and trusting people. They
                     murdered them and destroyed their city by fire. Catholic

                     Prosecutor: Do you think that any good children died in a city of "quiet and
                     trusting people"? Does this Bible C&V alter your view of the Biblical God’s
                     mass-murdering? Do these questions matter to any thinking juror today?

                     Judge: You are again in contempt of court! And, your crime, sir, far surpasses
                     any punishment you will receive!

                     Prosecutor: As prosecutor, I am doing my job, your honor. Can the
                     defense provide any sane defense of this mass-murdering God? 

                     Judge (whispers to himself) God-Damned Atheist.

                     131. Judges 20:22 The Israelites asked God: Should I again engage my brother in
                     battle? God said they should.

                     Prosecutor: The Biblical God condones His "Chosen Israelites" to mass-murder
                     each other.

                     132. Judges 20:24 But, when they met for the second time, God had His
                     Benjamites kill another 18,000 of His Israelites.

                     133. Judges 20:26-28 The Israelites offered sacrifice to the Lord and God said
                     to them: Attack tomorrow and I will deliver them to you.

                     134. Judges 20:35 On the 3rd day the Israelis killed 25,100 Benjamites.

                     Prosecutor: Are you adding up the death tolls?

                     135. Judges 20:48 The Israelites murdered the inhabitants of the Benjamite
                     cities they chanced upon. They destroyed, by fire, all the Benjamite /
                     Israities they came upon.

                     Prosecutor: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, is the Biblical God in control?
                     Did God have a legal, mental intent to kill all these people? Is there any
                     evidence that proves that people died who God did not intend to die? Have you
                     personally seen the result of this Biblical God / “One God of Abraham” direct
                     those who worship Him murder each other in current times? How about Protestant
                     and Catholics murdering each other? How about Muslims and Christians murdering
                     each other? All this killing takes place because of the insane, murderous
                     demands of this Biblical God - who is currently on trial.

                     Defense: Objection! How dare you presume to know the mind of God!

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     136. Judges 21:10-11 Twelve thousand (12,000) soldiers were ordered to
                     Jabesh-Gilead to murder those who lived there including women and children.

                     137. Judges 21:12&16 except for 400 virgins, God murdered all the Benjamite
                     women.

                     Prosecutor: It is obvious that any Human Being, who gets in the way of the
                     Biblical God’s agenda, God has them exterminated. By what criteria can the
                     Biblical God be considered good, just and fair?

                     Defense: (jumps up!) He is God! He is innocent because He is God. Praise God!
                     If any juror finds God guilty, he will face God's holy wrath on judgment day!

                     Prosecutor: (jumps up!) Your honor, I object to the defense threatening the
                     jury!

                     Judge: Sit down - both of you!

                     138. I Samuel 2:6-7 God kills, and makes alive; he makes the rich and the poor.

                     Prosecution: Hummm, God makes the rich and the poor. Ecclesiastes 10:19 states
                     that money answers all things.

                     Defense: Objection! Side-bar, your honor! (privately): "Judge, we, you and I,
                     and the Elect know this. The layman should not know it."

                     Judge: Agreed. The jury will disregard Ecclesiastes 10:19.

                     139. I Samuel 2:22 & 34 God’s priests are misusing tithes and having sexual
                     relations with women who serve at the meeting tent entrance. God will put them
                     to death which will gives rise to the priest, Samuel.

                     140. I Samuel 4:2 God had the enemy Philistines murder about 4,000 Israelites.

                     141. I Samuel 4:10-11 God killed 30,000 more Israelites and the 2 bad priests.

                     142. I Samuel 6:19 God slaughtered 50,070 men who looked into the Arc of God.
                     King James Version The　Catholic version depicts God slew only 70.

                     (This is one of very few differences between Bibles.)

                     143. I Samuel 15:3 God said: Go smite Amalek, utterly destroy all that they
                     have, spare them not; slay / murder both man and woman, babies and suckling.

                     Prosecutor: I again charge God with ordering the murdering of men, women and
                     children.

                     144. I Samuel 15:8-11 Saul killed but spared King Agag, alive. Then, God said:
                     I regret having made Saul King. He has not kept My command - (to murder all
                     that God wanted murdered).

                     145. I Samuel 15:18-19 Samuel, God’s prophet, said: Saul, go exterminate /
                     murder them. Why have you disobeyed the Lord?

                     Prosecutor: This is evidence that Saul did not kill all whom God wanted dead.

                     Defense: Objection! That's your interpretation!

                     Judge: Over-ruled.

                     146. I Samuel 15:23 Samuel said to Saul: Rebellion is sin. Because you have
                     rejected God’s command to murder them all, God has rejected you as ruler.

                     147. I Samuel 15:32-35 Samuel commanded to bring King Agag to him and Samuel
                     cut Agag to pieces before God. God regretted having made Saul King. KJV

                     Prosecution: Here is Samuel, God's prophet, cutting a King to pieces before
                     God.

                     148. I Samuel 18:25-27 (God’s chosen) David is given task to deliver 100
                     Philistine foreskins for a dowry. David murders 200 Philistines, circumcises
                     their corpses and counted them out before Saul to win Saul’s daughter, Michal.
                     Catholic.

                     149. I Samuel 19:9-10 An evil spirit from God came upon Saul and he tried to
                     nail David to the wall with a spear. David got away. Saul commanded: Bring
                     David up to me in bed so that I may kill him.

                     Prosecutor: An "evil spirit" came from Who? Let it sink in. An "evil spirit"
                     came from God to make Saul try to murder David.

                     Defense: Objection: The prosecution proves to be Biblically ignorant as no
                     "evil" could ever come from my perfect God.

                     Judge: Move along.

                     150. II Samuel 5:17-20 The Philistines searched for David. David asked God if
                     he should attack them. God said: Attack the Philistines! I will deliver them to
                     you. David attacked and defeated them.

                     151. II Samuel 6:1-8 David assembled 30,000 men of Israel to move the Arc of
                     God. Uzzah guided the Arc and reached out his hand to steady the Arc for the
                     oxen were making it tip. That angered God. God murdered Uzzah. David was
                     disturbed because God murdered Uzzah.

                     (Side-note: God had the Israelites build, by God’s specifications, this "arc"
                     which is an idol to God. The "caduceus" and the "arc" are both God-ordered
                     idols.)

                     152. II Samuel 7:9 God told David: I have been with you wherever you went and
                     have destroyed / murdered your enemies before you.

                     153. II Samuel 11:2-17 David knocked-up Uriah’s wife, Bathsheba. David ordered
                     Uriah - (Bathsheba’s husband) - one of David’s officers - Joab’s armor bearer -
                     to be killed in battle so that David could have his wife, Bathsheba.

                     Prosecutor: It is well documented that King David, who had Bathsheba's husband,
                     Uriah, killed, was one of the Biblical God's favorite characters in the entire
                     Bible. David, who lied, cheated, stole and killed was almost as evil as his
                     God.

                     Defense: Objection! (smoozing) God is good, just and fair - and God loves all
                     His children.

                     154. II Samuel 12:13-18 David shall not die. God, instead, murdered David’s and
                     Bathsheba’s baby at seven days of age.

                     Prosecutor: This is documented evidence of the "just and fairness" of the
                     Biblical God. 

                     155. II Samuel 24:15 God offered David 3 punishments to choose from. David
                     chose # 3, pestilence. God stopped murdering, by plague, His own Israelites at
                     70,000 dead.

                     156. I Chronicles 21:12-14 God used a destroying Angel and (God) sent　
                     pestilence upon (His Own Chosen) Israel and 70,000 men died.

                     Prosecutor: I charge God with murdering 70,000 more Human Beings by plague.

                     157. II Chronicles 13:15-18 God killed Jeroboam and all Israel. God delivered
                     them and Abijah and his people slew them. It was a great slaughter. 500,000
                     chosen men of Israel were slain. Prosecutor: I charge the Biblical God for the
                     murder of 500,000 of His Own chosen Israelites.

                     Mark Twain wrote: "These people's God has shown them by a million acts that he
                     respects none of the Bible's statutes. He breaks every one of them himself,
                     adultery and all".

                     Defense: Objection! Mark Twain was an Atheist slime-bag just like the
                     prosecutor!

                     Judge: Sustained! I told you about your "expert witnesses"! The jury is to
                     disregard Mark Twain.

                     158. II Chronicles 15:9-13 God murdered 1 million Ethiopians.

                     Prosecutor: I charge the Biblical God with the mass-murder of 1 million
                     Ethiopians. 

                     159. II Chronicles 15:12-13 Everyone small, great, man or woman, who would not
                     seek God will be put to death.

                     Prosecutor: Behold, the egocentric, jealous and insane mind of a
                     mass-murderer. 

                     160. I Kings 18:19&40 God had Elijah murder 450 prophets of Baal.

                     Prosecutor: Elijah, one of God's prophets, murdered 450 Human Beings.

                     Defense: Judge, God took Elijah to Himself in Heaven without Elijah ever dying.
                     God definitely loved his prophet Elijah no matter what he did.

                     161. I Kings 20:35-36 God caused a prophet to say to his companion: Strike me.
                     The companion refused. God’s prophet said: Since you did not obey the voice of                            
                     God, when we part a lion will kill you. When they parted a lion killed him.

                     162. II Kings 2:23-24 Elisha went up to Bethel. Some small boys jeered at
                     Elisha: "Go up bald head." Elisha cursed the small boys in the name of God and
                     two she-bears came out of the woods and tore 42 of the children to pieces.
                     Catholic

                     Prosecutor: I charge God with tearing apart 42 children just for calling His
                     prophet "bald head".

                     163. II Kings 17:26 & 36 God sent lions to kill people because they did not
                     know how to worship and sacrifice to God.

                     Prosecutor: I charge that God sent lions to kill people because God wanted
                     specific worship and sacrifice. This proves this character is insane and
                     egocentric.

                     Defense: Objection!

                     Prosecutor: Withdrawn! I’m sorry, your honor! Please withdraw my last statement
                     as I really do not want this heinous character to get off on an insanity plea.

                     Judge: Request denied! The statement stands.

                     164. II Kings 19:35 God’s Angel murdered 185,000 Assyrians.

                     Prosecutor: I charge that God used His "Hit-Angel" to murder 185,000 more Human
                     Beings.

                     (Again - Satan is NOT assumed to be God's "Death Angel")

                     165. Job 2:3 God said to Satan: You (Satan) enticed / moved / tempted Me (God)
                     against him (Job) to ruin him (Job) without cause.

                     Prosecutor: In Job 2:3, God confessed that He, God, was ultimately responsible
                     for the murders of Job’s children and his servants. God also confessed that
                     Satan successfully enticed / tempted / moved God - as documented in various
                     Bibles. Why would a "just" God send Human Beings into Eternal Torment for being
                     tempted / enticed / moved by Satan if God Himself was successfully tempted /
                     enticed / moved by Satan? Believers do believe God's sacred and inerrant words
                     in Job 2:3 - don't they? Christian believers claim that Satan is “the evil
                     one”, who tempts them to do evil, don't they? Why then, in "The Lord's Prayer",
                     do believers pray to God: "Lead Us NOT Into Temptation"?

                     166. Psalm 135:10 God, who smote great nations and slew mighty Kings...

                     167. Psalm 137:9 God's inspired Bible documents: Happy shall he be that taketh
                     and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.

                     Defense: Objection!

                     Prosecutor: If this isn't the Biblical God's confession of murder - what is?

                     168. Isaiah 13:18 God said: Have no mercy on infants, no compassion on
                     children.

                     Prosecutor: The Biblical has no mercy or compassion for infants and children.

                     169. Isaiah 14:21 God said: Prepare a place to slaughter his children for the
                     sins of their ancestors.

                     Prosecutor: God ordered / inspired Isaiah to make ready to slaughter the sons
                     for the guilt of their fathers. This documents that God orders to kill children
                     for the guilt / sins of their fathers - just like David's and Bathsheba's
                     7-day-old infant son had to die for their sin.

                     170. Isaiah 47:9 God said: You will be overtaken in a moment, on a single day:
                     loss of children and widowhood.

                     171. Isaiah 63:3-6 God said: I trample people in My anger and My wrath. The
                     people’s lifeblood spattered on My garments and stained all My robes. Vengeance
                     was in My heart. My arm brought Me victory. My wrath sustained Me. I trampled
                     down people in My anger. I crushed them in My wrath. I poured out their
                     lifeblood on the Earth.

                     Judge: I'm exhausted. Court will re-convene at 10 AM tomorrow morning. (Gavel)

                     =======================================================

                     Bailiff: All rise. Court is now in session.

                     Prosecutor: Good morning your honor; ladies and gentlemen of the jury.

                     172. Jeremiah 48:10 God said: Cursed be he who holds back his sword from blood.

                     Judge: Mister Prosecutor, I've had a couple sleepless nights because of you.
                     Yes, my ego is attached to God. I serve Him with every breath. Your charges
                     don't matter and as a judge, I'm compelled to testify to this jury and my court
                     that God depends on me to support and promote Him - to keep Him alive in the
                     hearts of believers. Now - you may resume.

                     Prosecutor: Judge, according to Lew Paz's book "Pushing Ultimate's", your
                     testimony is similar to the statement of Angelus Silesius who said: "I know God
                     cannot live one instant without me; were I to become nothing, he (God) would
                     give up the ghost".

                     Lew also wrote: "The Kabala clarifies the need God has of humanity to fulfill
                     "His" own enigmatic existence."

                     Prosecutor continues: Judge, and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I submit
                     that EGO and GOD are synonymous. Without your EGO, no GOD could exist to you.

                     Judge: You really are looking forward to some hard jail-time and Eternal
                     Damnation, aren't you? Resume.

                     173. Jeremiah 50:21 God said: Slaughter / doom them. Do all that I commanded
                     you.

                     174. Jeremiah 51:20-23 God said: With you I shatter man and woman, old and
                     youth, young man and woman. You are My weapon of war. With you, I will murder
                     nations, kingdoms, horse and rider, chariot and driver, man and wife, old and
                     young, youth and maiden.

                     Prosecutor: For believers, this is evidence that the Biblical God has served as
                     the murderous model for the tyrants in Human history.

                     175. Ezekiel 5:10-1 God said: Fathers shall eat sons, sons shall eat fathers.
                     I’ll inflict punishment on you and scatter you in every direction.

                     176. Ezekiel 5:11-15 God said: You have defiled My sanctuary. I will cut you
                     down, no pity, no, mercy. 1/3rd of you shall die of pestilence. 1/3rd of you
                     will die of the sword. I will scatter and pursue 1/3rd of you with the sword. I
                     will send famine against you and rob you of your children. I have jealousy,
                     anger and fury. I God have spoken in My jealousy. I will wreak My fury upon
                     them until I am appeased. They shall know I am God. I will make you a waste
                     among nations. I God have spoken.

                     Prosecutor: This shows God's motive, means and agenda for murder.

                     Defense (weakly): Objection.

                     177. Ezekiel 9:4-10 God said: Pass through Jerusalem. Mark an X (Catholic,
                     actually a T / Tau) on the forehead who complain of abominations practiced in
                     it. Do not look at them with pity or show any mercy. Slay utterly old and
                     young, both maids, little children and women. Wipe them out. Do not touch any
                     marked with the X. Defile the temple. Fill the court with the murdered. I
                     (Ezekiel) cried out: God, will you destroy all that is left in Israel? God
                     said: I will not show any mercy.

                     Prosecutor: Do believers - who know what this God has done - love or even like
                     this God?

                     Defense: I love my God with all my heart and soul. Praise God! You, are going
                     to Hell!

                     Judge (court-room commotion): Order in the court!　　

                     178. Ezekiel 18:3-4 God said: All souls (KJV) lives (Catholic) are Mine. All
                     sinners shall die.

                     Defense: (frustrated) Damn-it! All sinners should die - starting with you - you
                     Atheist Son-Of-A-Bitch!

                     Judge: Order! There will be order in my court!

                     Prosecutor: May I continue, your honor?

                     (The judge just glares at the prosecutor.)

                     179. Ezekiel 20:25 God said: I gave them statutes and ordinances that were not
                     good so they could not live.

                     Defense: Objection! Your honor, the prosecution is constantly twisting the
                     evidence to say what he wants it to say.

                     Prosecution: To the defense, if you find, in evidence, a Bible C&V error,
                     please, submit your correction.

                     180. Ezekiel 20:26-33 God said: I let them become defiled by their gifts, by
                     their immolation (sacrifice) of their first-born. They offered up their
                     sacrifices. Their offensive offerings sent up appeasing odors by making their
                     children pass through fire. As I live, says God, I will be King over you.
                     Catholic

                     Catholic Bible Note, Pg. 740: God permitted them to sacrifice their newborn
                     infants.

                     Prosecutor: I charge that God wanted them to sacrifice their newborn and that
                     they did so. God is not the type of character to permit something He didn’t
                     want. God again is shown to love to smell of burning fat - that the on-fire
                     burning children - produced.

                     Defense: Objection! That is too gross for any jury. Besides, the prosecution
                     cannot assume to know the mind, preferences and passions of almighty God!

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     181. Ezekiel 20:33 God said: I will claim the first fruits of your offerings.
                     As a pleasing odor, I accept you.

                     (Leviticus 1:9, 18 & 3:5 In sacrifice, the fragrance of the burning fat is
                     God’s.)

                     Prosecutor: Behold, ladies and Gentlemen of the jury. God is again referring to
                     His loving the smell of burning fat around Human organs; ergo, concerning your
                     children’s burning guts and fat. It is time to get this evil character off the
                     streets - isn’t it? Jepthah's daughter provided this smell for God as God
                     accepted Jepthah's burnt sacrifice of his daughter in Judges 11:30-39. 

                     182. Ezekiel 21:8-36 God said: I draw My sword and cut off from you the
                     virtuous and the wicked. Everyone shall know it shall not be sheathed again.
                     The sword has been sharpened to work slaughter. I have put a sharpened sword in
                     the hand of a slayer. I will pour out My indignation and fiery wrath on you. I
                     hand you over to ravaging men. You shall be fuel for the fire. Your blood shall
                     flow throughout the land.

                     Prosecutor: These are the words of an insane, mass-murderer.

                     Defense: Objection. Interpretation!

                     183. Ezekiel 23:22 God said: I will stir up your lovers against you from all
                     sides. I will let loose My jealousy against you, so that they will cut off your
                     nose and your ears; they will murder you and burn you. I will hand you over to
                     those you hate. They committed adultery with their idols. To feed them, they
                     sacrificed children they bore Me. They slew their children for their idols. Men
                     shall punish them with the sentence melted out for adultery and murder. God
                     said: Deliver them to terror and plunder.

                     Prosecutor: The Bible proves to be a handbook for terrorism.

                     Defense: My God, man, God has to put fear in the hearts of man so that man will
                     obey God.

                     184. Ezekiel 23:36-47 God said to me: Hack them to pieces and slay their sons
                     and daughters. Catholic

                     Prosecutor: I charge that God ordered stupid people to slay their sons and
                     daughters - and some obeyed God’s heinous order. Would you do this onto others?
                     Would you have others do this unto you? You can ask these questions concerning
                     all of these "God murders", just to figure out who you are. If you condone,
                     worship, promote, support and finance this God, you must condone these
                     murderous deeds that this God is documented to have done. Is this really the
                     God you love. Can you define "hypocrisy"? Evil harms people. Good does no harm.
                     Which is the Biblical God?

                     185. Ezekiel 25 God said: I will stretch out My hand against you. I will
                     execute great vengeance on them, punishing them furiously. They shall know I am
                     God when I wreak My vengeance on them. Her daughters shall be slaughtered on
                     the mainland by the sword; thus they shall know I am God. I bring King
                     Nebuchadnezzar against Tyre and he shall slay your daughters. He will slay your
                     people and pull your pillars to the ground. Never shall you rebuild. God has
                     spoken. I will thrust you down with those in the pit. I will make you dwell in
                     the nether lands, in the everlasting ruins, so you may never return to take
                     your place in the land of the living. I’ll make you a devastation. You shall be
                     no more. You’ll be sought, but never found again, so said God.

                     Prosecutor: Ladies and Gentlemen of the Jury, if the Biblical God's own diary,
                     the Bible, has any merit with you, you do not have to be a Crime Scene
                     Investigator (CSI) to produce more damaging evidence that the Biblical God is
                     guilty of all these murders.

                     Defense; Objection! Premature conclusion!

                     Judge: Moving on.

                     186. Ezekiel 28 God said: I will bring against you enemies that will murder
                     you. They shall thrust you down into the pit to die a bloodied corps. Will you
                     say: I am God when you face your murderers? I have brought out fire to devour
                     you to dust. You shall be no more. I am God and I inflict punishments and
                     pestilence to manifest My holiness. Blood shall flow in the streets.

                     Prosecutor: Can you identify a terrorist when you hear one?

                     187. Ezekiel 29 God said Pharaoh, the King of Egypt, I am coming at you. I give
                     Egypt to Babylon’s King Nebuchadnezzar. He shall carry off its riches,
                     plundering and pillaging it for the wages of his soldiers, who did it for Me.
                     As payment for his toil, I gave Egypt to him so they will know I am God, says
                     the Lord.

                     Prosecutor: I charge that God murdered people just to let them know He was God.
                     King Nebuchadnezzar was an enemy of God's chosen Hebrews. God turned on His
                     chosen people and used this King to capture and put His Hebrews into captivity.
                     God inspired King Nebuchadnezzar to write portions of His diary, the Bible.

                     Defense: Of course! Human Beings are not too smart. God had to get their
                     attention.

                     Judge (reaction from the crowd and the jury): Order in the court! There will be
                     order in my court!

                     188. Ezekiel 30 God said: I will murder the multitude of Egypt by the hand of
                     Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. His people, the most terrible of the nations,
                     shall destroy the land. They shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill
                     the land with the slain. They shall know that I am God when I set fire to Egypt
                     and break all who help her. My command to terrify unsuspecting Ethiopia is
                     coming. I shall put an end of Egypt by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. He and his
                     most ruthless people shall be brought in to devastate the land. They shall fill
                     Egypt with the slain. Everything I hand over to the foreigners to devastate. I,
                     God have spoken. I will inflict punishment on Egypt that they may know that I
                     am the Lord. I will break Pharaoh and strengthen the King of Babylon by putting
                     My sword in his hand. They shall know I am God.

                     Prosecutor: God is documented to have said in Ezekiel 30: My command to terrify
                     unsuspecting Ethiopia is coming? What? God, again, just qualified His Bible to
                     be a terrorist textbook. Are you sure this insane God / Character, fictitious
                     or not, isn’t called Allah 9/11? In depicting murderous evil, Islam's Qur'an
                     has nothing over the Judeo-Christian Bible.

                     Defense: Objection! That heathen book, the Qur'an, has absolutely nothing to do
                     with God and the Bible.

                     Prosecutor: Your honor, and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the Judeo-
                     Christian God and the Koran's Allah are the same exact Character - the "One God
                     of Abraham". If you say something against Allah - you are saying something
                     against your Judeo-Christian God.

                     Defense: Objection! Blasphemy! Blasphemy. Your honor!

                     Judge: I'll see both counsels in my chambers.

                     (Court continued:)

                     Judge: For the purposes of this trial, the jury is directed to disregard the
                     fact that the Judeo-Christian God and the Koran's Allah are the same character.

                     189. Ezekiel 39:17-19 God said: You shall have flesh to eat and blood to drink
                     - and drink blood until you are drunk.

                     Prosecutor: Consider this - each of you. How does your personal god resemble
                     the God of the Bible?

                     Defense: Objection! Personal god's are of no concern here. There is only one
                     God!

                     Judge: Sustained.

                     Prosecutor continues: Judge, and ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I submit
                     that EGO and GOD are synonymous. Without your EGO, no GOD could exist to you.

                     Judge: You really are looking forward to some hard jail-time and
                     Eternal-Damnation, aren't you? Resume.

                     190. Hosea 10:14 God said: The roar of battle will rise against your people so
                     that all your fortresses will be devastated on the day of battle when mothers
                     are dashed to the ground with their children.

                     191. Hosea 13:16 God said: They shall fall by the sword, their little ones
                     shall be dashed to pieces, their expectant mothers shall be ripped open.

                     192. Nahum 3:10 God said: She was taken captive and went into exile. Her
                     infants were dashed to pieces at every street corner.

                     Judge: My God, Man. Do you learn nothing! Humble yourself! Lay off the
                     children!

                     (A pregnant woman in the jury threw up.)

                     193. Zechariah 13:3 God commanded: If a man prophesies a lie in the name of the
                     Lord, his father and mother, shall thrust him through.

                     Prosecutor: God actually demands that mothers and fathers murder their
                     offspring for him.    

                     194. Zechariah 14:2 God said: I will gather all the nations to Jerusalem to
                     fight against it. The city will be captured, the houses ransacked, and the
                     women raped.

                     Prosecutor: This is evidence that the Biblical God not only murders but God
                     causes rape. Is this the Biblical God that you find yourself to worship, adore,
                     praise, promote, support and finance? If so - WHY?

                     Judge: I'll see both counsels in my chambers. (gavel) I'm exhausted. Court will
                     re-convene at 10 AM tomorrow morning.

                     =================================================================

                                                      New Testament


                     Bailiff: All rise. Court is now in session.

                     Prosecutor: Good morning Judge and ladies and gentlemen.

                     195. Acts 5:1-10 Ananias and Sapphira sold their land, kept some of the money
                     and gave the rest to the Peter. Peter asked Ananias why Satan filled his heart
                     to retain part of his money. Ananias fell dead. Peter asked Sapphira, his wife,
                     Did you sell your land for this amount? She said: Yes. Then, Peter said: Do you
                     test God? She also fell and died.

                     Prosecutor: God murdered Ananias and Sapphira - or "Saint" Peter, The
                     Cornerstone of The Catholic Church, murdered both of them because they did not
                     give all of their money to the cause. Peter, or God, wanted, expected and
                     obviously felt entitled to all of their money, so they had to die. If the money
                     belonged to Ananias and Sapphira, how did the punishment of death for both of
                     them fit the crime? Or, did God and Peter rob and kill them?

                     196. Luke 19:27 Jesus, Christ said: And, as for those, Mine enemies, who would
                     not have Me be King over them, bring them before Me and slay them.　

                     Prosecutor: Jesus Christ, who many Chistians believe to be the Old Testamnet
                     God, demands that if you you do not make Him King over you, to bring you before
                     Him and to slay you. If Jesus Christ IS the Old Testamnet God, then Jesus
                     Christ is guilty of all the counts of murder exhibited in this trial.

                     197. Revelation 2:23 The Son of Man, (Jesus Christ) said: "I will kill her
                     children"...

                     Prosecutor: Ladies and gentlemen, if Jesus Christ would slay Human Beings who
                     would not have Jesus be King and rule over them - as documented in Luke 19:27
                     and if Jesus would, for any reason, kill a woman's children - as documented in
                     Revelation 2:23 - Jesus Christ loses me. Do you absolutely know that Jesus
                     Christ is the God of The Old Testament? If so, did Jesus Christ do all "The God
                     Murders" that are documented C&V in The Old Testament?

                     Prosecutor: Now, ladies and gentlemen, behold the most notorious of all of the
                     Biblical God's murders:

                     Matthew 26:39 Jesus cried out to God: "My Father, if possible, let this cup
                     pass from me."

                     Prosecutor: It is documented that Jesus Christ begged His Father, the Biblical
                     God, to save Him from death - three (3) times.

                     198. Matthew 27:46 Jesus (on the cross) said: My God, My God, why hast Thou
                     forsaken Me?

                     Prosecutor: By Jesus Christ's personal testimony, the "in control" Biblical God
                     intentionally forsakes His only begotten Son, by having Jesus tortured and
                     crucified which fulfilled God's pre-meditated and murderous agenda.　

                     Defense: Objection: The prosecutor can not possibly know the mind of God!

                                       My God, My God, Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?

                     　

                     Judge: Enough! Kill that graphic! Ah, take that graphic down. You are done! The
                     prosecution will conclude and sum up on the charges.

                     Prosecutor: But Judge, there are so many more!

                     Judge (gavel): This court orders you to sum up!

                     Prosecutor: But judge, there are so many more Bible C&Vs remaining that also
                     depict "The God Murders". One written testimony submitted: 399,933 Human Beings
                     were directly murdered by the Biblical God plus 2,017,956 murdered by God’s
                     followers which equals 2,417,889 plus unknown millions of Human Beings murdered
                     by God. How many millions of Egypt's firstborn did one of God's Death-Angles
                     murder on God's orders? God's One of God's Death-Angel also murdered 1 million
                     Ethiopians, 500,000 Israelites and probably millions, including the whole
                     world, at the time of Noah. God murdered every man, woman and child in over
                     60 entire cities at the time of Moses and Joshua! I request more time. Some
                     writers have estimated God's murders to be over 25 million within the pages of
                     the Bible.

                     Judge: (gavel!) (shouting) Request denied! Your time is up. Proceed with your
                     summery now so we can dismiss this sham of a trial and get down to some humble,
                     much needed prayer! We will take a 10-minute recess. When we come back, you
                     will cut it short and sum up.

                                                 The Prosecution Summary


                                                           　

                     Prosecutor: Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury. Is it not time to retire the
                     Biblical God and His Bible to the Smithsonian Institute Library? It belongs
                     along side the　artifacts of other historical murdering and land-stealing
                     criminals like Moses, Joshua, David, Alexander The Great, Ganges Khan, Attila
                     the Hun, Hannibal, Caesar, Nero, Caligula, Napoleon, Adolf Hitler, Josef
                     Stalin, Pol Pot, and George W. Bush - to name a few.

                     Defense: (jumps up!) Objection! George W. Bush was a great President and God
                     told him to attack Iraq! God chose President George W. Bush to rule over The
                     United States of America. George W. Bush is not guilty because he was justified
                     by God!

                     Prosecutor: Jeremiah 49:19 states that the Biblical God said: Who can call Me
                     to account?

                     Jeremiah 50:44 states that the Biblical God said: Who calls Me to account?

                     I, Gary W. DeVaney, call the Biblical God, fictitious or not, to account based
                     on Bible documented C&V evidence.

                     Yes, should God not exist, it is impossible to punish the Biblical God, under
                     US criminal charges, . However, under US civil charges, if the preponderance of
                     the evidence proves that God is over 50% guilty of the wrongful death charges,
                     according to US criminal law and documented evidence, God is liable. If the
                     Biblical God is responsible for unlawful Human deaths to satisfy His own sacred
                     feelings and heinous agendas; then, couldn’t God be banished from humanity by
                     humanity further rejecting God's criminal influence?

                     If believers stop supporting this Biblical God’s myth, and stop filling the
                     collection plate, the Biblical God, like so many other myths and gods of old,
                     will also eventually fade away. The learning of and the supporting of decent,
                     unbiased civil and criminal laws can reasonably, logically and successfully
                     replace this ancient, corrupt, insane and murderous God-model. For justice to
                     be true, justice must be blind as to who is put on trial for their criminal
                     deeds. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, justice must not recognize favoritism.
                     Isn’t it time that humanity outgrew this voodoo God, and these dark ages?

                      

                                              PROSECUTION CLOSING STATEMENT
                                                           　

                                                     A Dreadful God


                     Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, what more can be said about a dreadful God? A
                     God who duplicates God’s evil within the genetics God creates. This is a God
                     Who takes pleasure in the sacrificial destruction of innocent animals and who
                     demands no-prisoner-war between Human Beings. An unchanging "in control" God
                     Who feasts upon the bizarre entertainment of their destroying one another while
                     sitting amused and with immunity.

                     Blood and burning guts appear to appease God's savage passions. The Biblical
                     God seems to enjoy bizarre pleasures and to occasionally become intoxicated by
                     His angry wickedness of murder. With each event, God's mind appears more
                     addicted and sicker, passionately craving to sternly top the previous holocaust
                     of horror, torture, anguish, death; the physical and emotional pain which feeds
                     His ecstasy.

                     This is the God of the Bible, who people still worship today for His "wonderful
                     plagues". A God, Who invents new and less boring ways to slaughter and torment
                     His creations on Earth and then, after death, sentences them into "Eternal
                     Torment".

                     What more can be said?
                     　
                     THE PROSECUTION RESTS…
