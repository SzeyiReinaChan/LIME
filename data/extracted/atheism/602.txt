Welcome

Welcome to the K-State Individuals for Freethought web site! More about the
club and Freethought is below and on the pages linked on the left.

What is Freethought?

Freethought is thinking without the restraints of religious tradition, dogma,
"revelation," authoritarianism, or prejudice. Instead, freethinkers use reason
and science to form their own conclusions about morality and the nature of the
universe.

What is Individuals for Freethought?

Individuals for Freethought is an organization at K-State that brings together
atheists, skeptics, humanists and others who value independent thought. IF uses
science and reason to counter dogma and authoritarianism, provides a voice and
a community for freethinkers, fosters acceptance of non-theistic people, and
advocates separation of church and state.
