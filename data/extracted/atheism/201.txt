N.W. Barker

Most are aware by now that a tragedy occurred as Acharya S/D.M. Murdock passed
away due to cancer on December 25th, 2015. The cancer became resistant and came
back very aggressively and took over her immune system and liver.
Chemo-sensitivity testing revealed that absolutely nothing available can stop
this type of cancer at this time. […]

Cancer is a ‘judgment from God?’

August 2, 2015
Acharya S/D.M. Murdock
15 Comments

Some demented Christians are claiming, of course, that my cancer is “God’s
judgment.” Unfortunately for these utter idiots, most cancer cases in the
United States are occurring in CHRISTIANS, so are they also being judged by
God? But thanks for demonstrating once again what a horrible and unloving “god”
you follow! Torturing those who don’t believe […]

Baghdadi the Islamic State caliph isn't a 'real Muslim?'

Many people today deny that the violent and fanatical Islamic State or ISIL/
ISIS is actually Islamic. Appalled by its horrendous crimes against humanity,
political and religious leaders and members of the public alike have been
scrambling to claim that “the Islamic State isn’t really Islamic.” Muslims who
deny ISIL’s members as “real Muslims” are engaging […]

Rabbi: Did Jesus actually exist?

Below is a talk by “countermissionary” and “Jewish apologist” Rabbi Tovia
Singer regarding “Jesus mythicism” or the opinion that Jesus Christ is a
mythical figure. Initially, I thought Singer would adhere to the typical
“historical Jesus” party line, proffering “proofs” that have been rebutted for
centuries. I was pleasantly surprised at certain parts as I […]

Over the decades that I’ve been writing about and teaching what is called

the one thing most of them have in common is that they have never read my work

The Hindu sky god Varuna riding a sea monster (1675-1700 AD/CE)

I’m such a nerd. I’m fascinated with listening to this Proto-Indo-European
reconstruction and with reading the accompanying text, figuring out which words
are what. The date for this hypothesized language’s spread from the Russian
Steppes to Ireland would be about 8,000 to 3,000 years ago. Amazingly, there
are some recognizable words in Proto-Indo-European (“PIE”), such […]

Just as declaring oneself an atheist does not make one automatically an expert
in religion, seeing Jesus as a myth does not make someone an automatic expert
in Christian origins. There are many people calling themselves “mythicists” –
i.e., someone who views various biblical/supernatural figures as mythical, not
historical – who are not experts in […]

Bart Ehrman's ignorance

In a blog from December 2014, New Testament scholar and ex-evangelical
Christian Bart Ehrman tries his hand at comparative religion and mythology,
which is clearly not his forté. Indeed, Ehrman demonstrates abundantly his
non-expertise in the subject by making blatantly false claims, so we must
wonder why he is pretending to be an expert? After […]

WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT ACHARYA S/D.M. MURDOCK

"Previously I have interviewed Frank Zindler, Richard Carrier, David Fitzgerald
and Robert Price, all of whom are ‘mythicists'; they don’t think there was ever
anyone alive whom we could recognize as either Jesus or Moses. Of the lot of
them, I would have thought that Price was the foremost expert, but he referred
me to D.M. Murdock, also known as Acharya S, author of Did Moses Exist? The
Myth of the Israelite Lawgiver, an impressive piece of work. It’s definitive.”
—Aron Ra, president, American Atheists-TX

“There are no words that can adequately thank you enough. You are a sensitive
soul whose presence enlightens the world. I hope your readers realize what an
incredible lady (human being) you are. I am proud to call you my friend. I send
best wishes.” —Amil Imani, Iranian democracy activist and writer

“I have seen your site – smart, thoughtful, savvy! Great video! You put a lot
of work into this, Acharya.” —Deven Green, creator of Mrs. Betty Bowers,
America’s Best Christian

“Your scholarship is relentless! …the research conducted by D.M. Murdock
concerning the myth of Jesus Christ is certainly both valuable and worthy of
consideration.” —Dr. Kenneth L. Feder, Professor of Archaeology, Central
Connecticut State University, Frauds, Myths, and Mysteries: Science and
Pseudoscience In Archaeology

“I find myself in full agreement with Acharya S/D.M. Murdock… I find it
undeniable that…many, many of the epic heroes and ancient patriarchs and
matriarchs of the Old Testament were personified stars, planets, and
constellations…” —Dr. Robert M. Price, The Pre-Nicene New Testament

“I can recommend your work whole-heartedly!” —Dr. Robert Eisenman, James the
Brother of Jesus and The New Testament Code, RobertEisenman.com

“Well-referenced, with numerous quotations from renowned Egyptologists and
classical scholars, Acharya’s penetrating research clearly lays out the very
ancient pre-Christian basis of modern Christianity. Those who espouse
Christianity beware! After digesting the evidence, you will never again view
your religion in the same light.” —Dr. Robert M. Schoch, Professor of Natural
Science College of General Studies at Boston University; Author, Pyramid Quest,
Voyages of the Pyramid Builders and Voices of the Rocks

“Acharya S deserves to be recognized as a leading researcher and an expert in
the field of comparative mythology, on a par with James Frazer or Robert
Graves—indeed, superior to those forerunners in the frankness of her
conclusions and the volume of her evidence.” —Barbara Walker, The Women’s
Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets and Man Made God

“I’ve known people with triple Ph.D’s who haven’t come close to the scholarship
in Who Was Jesus?” —Pastor David Bruce, M.Div, North Park Seminary, Chicago,
HollywoodJesus.com

“Thirty years ago, when in divinity school, I might have had second thoughts
about becoming an Episcopal priest if a book like D. M. Murdock’s Who Was
Jesus? had been available to me.” —Bob Semes, Retired university professor of
History and Religion, Founder and Executive Director of The Jefferson Center

“In addition to presenting in Suns of God the troubling history of religious
wars in an easily followed narrative, Acharya goes a step further, explaining
as only she can how a once-simplistic idea has been carried into our modern
world with terrible and nearly unimaginable results.” —Rev. Dr. W. Sumner
Davis, Fellow, Royal Astronomical Society; Member, American Geophysical Union;
Affiliate, New York Academy of Science

“Ms. Murdock is one of only a tiny number of scholars with the richly diverse
academic background (and the necessary courage) to adequately address the
question of whether Jesus Christ truly existed as a walking-talking figure in
first-century Palestine.” —David Mills, Atheist Universe

“Thank you, Acharya, for the important work you are doing. Who Was Jesus?
Fingerprints of the Christ just might be the best short introduction to
Biblical scholarship yet.” —David Bergland, 1984 Libertarian Party Presidential
Candidate, Libertarianism In One Lesson

“…I have found her scholarship, research, knowledge of the original languages,
and creative linkages to be breathtaking and highly stimulating.” — Rev. Dr.
Jon Burnham, Pastor, Presbyterian Church, Houston, TX

“Acharya S has done a superb job in bringing together the rich panoply of
ancient world mythology and culture, and presenting it in a comprehensive and
compelling fashion.” —Earl Doherty, The Jesus Puzzle

“Acharya S is a shining light of truth in a sea of deceit.” —Rob McConnell, X
Zone Radio/TV, Ontario, Canada

“The Christ Conspiracy—very, very scholarly and wholly researched—is a book for
today…” Rev. B. Strauss, ex-Catholic Priest, Chicago, IL

“Amidst the global chaos of George Bush’s War on Terror, largely founded on
religious intolerance and simplistic notions of good and evil, Acharya S is the
voice of reason.” —Joan D’Arc, Paranoia

“D.M. Murdock could well be the most brilliant, insightful and rigorous
theologian writing today.” —Robert Tulip

“Acharya S is the ranking religious philosopher of our era.” —John K.

“Acharya S/Murdock deserves an award for her hard work and courage. She is the
Galileo of our day!” —Charles Johnson

“Acharya S knows more about the ancient Mysteries than any living scholar.”
—Christopher Knowles

“Acharya S is an amazing researcher with a tremendous amount of energy and
appetite for constant discovery of newer horizons. ” —Dr. O.P. Sudrania

“D.M. Murdock is a genius. Her scholarship on this subject is impeccable and
has conducted the most thorough research I’ve ever read.” —David Kim

“Acharya Murdock’s work is so important, so clear and so timely!” —Theresa
Weiss, PowerPlaces.com

“I am Hindu, and I read the Bhaagavatham in which the life of Krishna is
detailed. I also read your works, and I endorse you. Keep up the good work.”
—Murali Chemuturi

“Sooooooo glad you continue to spread your messages! Having had the privilege
to meet with you face-to-face and share lunch some years back, I certainly can
vouch for you to be a sincere, warm, caring and highly engaging individual, and
this world is all the better because of you.

“Having known Acharya for quite some time, and although our life’s paths have
diverged, she is never far from mind, and all thoughts are positive. She is a
solid driving force for all things wise, good and useful that make this earth a
tad bit better. We could use millions more like her.” —Robert W.Morgan
