Black Nonbelievers (BN) is a 501 c3 non-profit fellowship of nonbelievers
headquartered in the Atlanta area that is dedicated to providing an
informative, caring, festive and friendly environment. We strive to connect
with other Blacks (and their allies) who are living free of religion and
irrational beliefs, and might otherwise be shunned by family and
friends. Instead of accepting dogma, we seek to determine truth
and morality through reason and evidence.

BN welcomes all regardless of sex, sexuality, gender identity, age, national
origin or race. We extend a caring embrace to all who wish to participate
in exploring a meaningful rational life.

Mission
The mission of Black Nonbelievers is to…
• Provide secular fellowship.
• Nurture and support nonbelievers in coming out.
• Promote atheist pride.
• Organize nonbelievers for charitable causes.

Meetings
BN members meet to discuss topics relevant to secular living as well as
to socialize and offer support. We also offer workshops, and other gatherings
to educate the public on the views of nonbelievers. Unless otherwise noted, all
meetings and events are open to the general public. (See our Calendar for
details on specific meetings and activities.)

Why is this a fellowship of ‘nonbelievers’?
The word ‘nonbeliever’ speaks to the kind of mindset we encourage. We encourage
people to move from  a mindset of faith and belief to reason and rationality.
We aren’t just nonbelievers in religion. We are nonbelievers in any claim,
religious or otherwise, that is not supported by good evidence. Each of us may
be at different stages on the journey of rational enlightenment. As
freethinkers (rational nonbelievers) we evaluate beliefs and claims,
then reconsider our position when the evidence calls for a different
conclusion.

We now have affiliate groups in the following cities:
Charlotte
Chicago
Dallas
Detroit
DC
Louisville
Milwaukee
Memphis
Orlando

Black Nonbelievers can also be found on Facebook, Twitter (@BNonbelievers)and
Meetup.com!
