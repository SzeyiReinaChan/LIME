The Islamic State - Vice


August 2014 on Vice

    The Islamic State, a hardline Sunni jihadist group that formerly had ties
    to al Qaeda, has conquered large swathes of Iraq and Syria. Previously
    known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the group has
    announced its intention to reestablish the caliphate and has declared its
    leader, the shadowy Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as the caliph.

    The lightning advances the Islamic State made across Syria and Iraq in June
    shocked the world. But it's not just the group's military victories that
    have garnered attention — it's also the pace with which its members have
    begun to carve out a viable state.

    Flush with cash and US weapons seized during its advances in Iraq, the
    Islamic State's expansion shows no sign of slowing down. In the first week
    of August alone, Islamic State fighters have taken over new areas in
    northern Iraq, encroaching on Kurdish territory and sending Christians and
    other minorities fleeing as reports of massacres emerged.

    VICE News reporter Medyan Dairieh spent three weeks embedded with the
    Islamic State, gaining unprecedented access to the group in Iraq and Syria
    as the first and only journalist to document its inner workings.

BBC Panorama: From Jail to Jihad


First broadcast May 12, 2014 on BBC One

    The Muslim prison population in England and Wales has doubled in the past
    ten years to nearly one in seven inmates. This rise is five times faster
    than the increase in the overall jail population.
    Evidence shows most Muslims are not radicalised, but the prison system is
    also home to the UK's greatest concentration of Islamic terrorists and
    extremists. Many more are converted or radicalised behind bars. 

    Reporter Raphael Rowe follows one radical convert as he leaves prison,
    interviews some convicted terrorists and extremists about their experiences
    inside and asks if the authorities are doing enough to prevent the
    increasing threat of radical Islam inside prison.

FOX: Megyn Kelly Brawls With Atheist Over 'God' in Air Force Oath


October 24, 2013 on Fox News

    Megyn Kelly took on former Air Force office and atheist Mikey Weinstein on
    Wednesday over the invocation of God in the Air Force oath, with the
    conversation getting so heated Kelly had to practically shout, "Mikey,
    chill!" at one point. Weinstein also sporadically mocked the "Fox world" he
    jumped into and got so frustrated he told Kelly he would try to speak in
    one-syllable words only.

    Kelly asked Weinstein why he just can't let the invocation of God be
    optional. Weinstein shot back, "That's like saying why don't you just opt
    out of robbing a bank! Because robbing a bank violates the law."

Neil deGrasse Tyson: Creationism is fine ‘as long as you don’t confuse it with
actual science’


From Raw Story:

    Wednesday on his radio show “Star Talk,” astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson
    addressed a reader’s query about the Creation Museum and the theory of a
    “Young Earth,” which is part of the Christian Creationist myth, the idea
    that the Earth is only a few thousand years old.

    “I visited the Creation Museum,” wrote the listener, “purely out of a sense
    of mystified curiosity. The recorded narration in their planetarium said
    that contemporary astrophysics predicted [sic] that certain stars were
    older than the known age of the universe and cited this problem as evidence
    against science and for Young Earth creationism.”

    “I was hoping Neil might tell me a little bit more about the problem and
    its solution,” the note concluded.

    “Which problem?” asked Tyson. “That the Creation Museum exists at all?”

    He went on to say that while he has nothing against Creationism museums,
    per se, “just keep it out of the science classroom.”

    “We live in a free country,” he continued, “and you can say whatever you
    want about whatever. That’s what it means to be free. Just don’t confuse it
    with actual science.”

An Appetite for Wonder: Richard Dawkins in Conversation with Adam Rutherford


    Professor Richard Dawkins discusses the influences and inspirations that
    have shaped his life and thinking.

    Chatting to science broadcaster Adam Rutherford in the world-famous Ri
    Lecture Theatre, the pioneering scientist and public thinker reveals how he
    developed an "appetite for wonder" for the biological sciences.

    From his upbringing in Nairobi and Nyasaland (now Malawi) to his early
    experiences with religion, Dawkins talks about his motivations for becoming
    a scientist and his experiences at Oxford University and Berkeley,
    California during a period of social and political unrest.

    Find out how he arrived at the idea of the "selfish gene" -- the basis of
    his seminal 1976 publication, one of the best-selling popular science books
    ever written -- and discover more about his research and writing process.

    Plus, the Ri audience ask a range of revealing questions -- from how he
    overcome his natural shyness and stutter at school to what his advice would
    be to an 18 year old who wants to get into popular science.

    "An Appetite for Wonder" author Richard Dawkins discusses the relative
    existential dangers of science and religion.

Origins Of Us | Dr. Alice Roberts | BBC Documentary


Part 1 | Part 2 | Part 3

    Origins of Us tells the story of our species, homo sapiens. In every one of
    our bodies is the evidence of how we evolved away from our ape cousins to
    become the adaptable, successful species we are today.

    Anatomist and physical anthropologist Dr Alice Roberts reveals the key
    adaptations in our body that has contributed to our extra-ordinary success.
    Far from being inevitable, the evolution of our species is a product of
    pure chance. And with each anatomical advantage comes a cost, which many of
    us are still paying today. Bad backs, painful childbirth, impacted wisdom
    teeth are all a by-product of our evolutionary success.

    This is a journey through your own body, 6 million years and 300 000
    generations of our family, from a tree dwelling ape in the forests of
    Africa, to you and the six billion other humans on Earth today.
