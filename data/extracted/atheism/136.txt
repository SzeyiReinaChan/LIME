About the show

The Herd Mentality Podcast is a project I'm working hard on to build a
sustainable life.

Anyone can come on the show! Just fill in the form above with your
@twitterhandle, email and a topic you'd like to discuss. I'll try and match you
with similar guests.

I try to get as many people as I can on, but I can't guarantee all calls will
make it to air. :)
