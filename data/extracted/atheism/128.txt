Eric Sterling, Barry Lynn

August 29 . 2013

Eric Sterling with the Criminal Justice Policy Foundation talks about easing
overcrowding in federal prisons by ordering prosecutors to omit listing
quantities of illegal substances in indictments for low-level drug cases,
sidestepping federal laws that impose strict mandatory minimum sentences for
drug-related offenses. Later Barry Lynn bids farewell to Culture Shocks.
