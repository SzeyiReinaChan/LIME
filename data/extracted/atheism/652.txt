Activism Religion, Religion Lights, Catholicchurch Streetlights, Catholic
Churches, American Churches, Atheism Religion Science

Atheism, Religion, God is Imaginary. ...The church argued that god very clearly
established the delineation between night and day, and putting lights up after
sundown flew in the face of god's law.

Early American churches rallied against lightening rods for the same reason.
Modern Fundie Xtians do the same against condoms, hormonal birth control, &
vaccinations. Somehow they accepted seat belts and smoke alarms with less
resistance. ;)

Catholic Church. In 1831 16 even been gaslighting and papal states. No your
popes.

This is how ridiculous your religions are. Tho, not as archaic as they were,
they're not as advanced as they should be.. But if they were to advance to our
day in time they would be nonexistent.

Talk about being a control freak... :P - http://holesinthefoam.us/
catholicchurch-streetlights/

To Remain in the Dark is Christian. Pope Gregory XVI opposed innovation of
almost any kind and is probably most famous for his opposition to gas street
lights and railways. His fear was that modernization would promote commerce and
increase the power of the middle class, leading to demands for liberal reforms
which would undermine the monarchical power of the Pope and Catholic church.
The only good that came from him was his encyclical against slavery in 1839.

The Catholic church originally banned has lighting.

God, Prayer Serves, I M, Atheism, Anti Religion, Truth, Thought, Atheist

Atheism, Religion, God is Imaginary, Prayer, God's Plan. Pray for something Is
that something in god's divine plan? Yes --> Prayer is redundant. No --> Prayer
is futile. Prayer serves no purpose. If you believe your god is infallible and
that he/she/it has a plan then praying is useless.

Prayer - I know people who feel this way. I prefer to think of prayer as
bending Go's ears with God's promises.

Seems rather obvious. Perhaps even prayer is sinful because it's trying to
persuade god, who has it all figured out already.....

If you pray for something god already has in store for you, you're wasting his
time. If you pray for something he isn't going to put in your life, you're
wasting your time and probably insulting him in the process. It's HIS plan...
who are YOU to try and change his mind?

"Two hands working can do more than a thousand clasped in prayer." ‚ÄúIs God
willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able,
but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then
whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?‚Äù
Epicurus quote

Prayer is a Waste of Time! God isn't Real...there is No Divine Plan!

Atheism, Religion, Judaism, Christianity, Islam, God is Imaginary. The Jew
says, "Christians and Muslims are wrong." The Christian says, "Jews and Muslims
are wrong." The Muslim says, "Jews and Christians are wrong." The atheist says,
"You're all correct."

Sure, I don't think any of them are right, but I'm not going to go to other
countries telling people their gods don't exist just because I don't believe in
them. I would expect them to give me that same respect. Religion can be a
beautiful thing when it is used for love, not power. <3
