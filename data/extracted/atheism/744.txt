If you came here looking for pet photos or fortune cookies...

Sorry, good-things.org is currently in idle.

The pet photos I will try and fit in somehow. I haven't updated that part of
the site for years. But I do have some photos, including pets, at my photo site
.

The fortune cookies were taken down some time ago due to a copyright problem
with the collection. Coincidentally, the day I took down good-things.org, the
man who actually maintains the collection (all I ever did was write the random
servers) gave me a new, copyright clear version.

NEWS: Those of you who used my "freethought quote on your own web site" service
can upgrade. Click here for instructions. The old GIF based system is no longer
available, but this is better in my opinion.

My current plan is to dedicate my so-called spare time to my photo site and the
various American Atheists web sites, for whom I am volunteer webmaster.

My apologies. When I set up good-things.org, it had been my intention to
maintain it more or less permanently.

Where to go:

  • My online Photo Gallery - Go ahead, you'll like it, really.
  • Random Quote Selection
  • Can-Do Productions Web Design
  • Randi Rhodes Radio Archives - excellent talk radio
