The Humanist and Freethinkers of Cape Fear (HFCF) is a diverse group of
Humanists, Atheists, Agnostics, Freethinkers, Rationalists, Sceptics, and all
those who question organized religion. HFCF is a chapter of the American
Humanist Association. HFCF uses Meetup.com to publicize its upcoming social
events and programs.

Using this Meetup site is free; if you would like to learn more about HFCF and
become a dues-paying member, visit us at Humanists and Freethinkers of Cape
Fear website.

HFCF organizes monthly meetings with various nationally recognized speakers,
and an exciting calendar of events and social activities. We welcome people
with an interest in promoting secularism, social justice, environmentalism,
peace, and personal liberty. This Meetup group is about encouraging discussion,
having fun and building friendships.

Help us maintain a positive, polite online community by adhering to the
following membership guidelines:

• Ensure that your profile name is real - no aliases, fictional characters or
silly combinations of symbols and numbers will be accepted for membership.

• Add a photo to your profile. This isn't a requirement, but we like to know
who you are when you attend HFCF events!

• Resist any temptation to troll, harass, spam, self-promote, or engage in any
of those other "non-productive social networking behaviors."

• Use the Meetup message function to relay personal communications and be
courteous not to infringe upon any other member's privacy.

Please note that this Meetup group is paid and maintained by the HFCF Board
(co-organizers), and that HFCF reserves the right delete and/or block any
members, without notice, who violate the basic protocols of social networking.

We're 369 Humanists and Freethinkers
