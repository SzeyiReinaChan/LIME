It's not rocket science. Far from it. It's religion and it's stupid. That's
probably why some religious people fail to understand that hate and fear are
negative emotions, the realm of Satan, that override the human reasoning
capabilities God gave people and love. That is all.

Dichotomous Xmas

Christmas is a weird holiday. On the one hand you are celebrating the birth of
a mythical figure that a ridiculous number of people believe really exists,
while waiting around for another mythical figure to arrive with a pantload of
presents that almost everyone knows is ridiculous to believe in. If only young
children could develop the same skepticism about the Baby Jesus as they
eventually do about Father Christmas.

The dichotomy seems to stem from the fact that Baby Jesus is expected to return
only once, on Judgment Day, which will, rumor has it, come without warning
(anxiety!). Father Christmas though has an annual, rigidly scheduled arrival
date. So empirical observation quickly dispels any belief in the latter after
just a few years of disappointment. Baby Jesus was smart not to give himself
any hard deadlines like that. He can wank off as long as he wants and get down
to this Armageddon business whenever it suits him. He didn't give humans a
metric on which to measure his due diligence. Father Christmas, conversely,
pretty much structured himself right out of existence.

These presents that Santa is supposed to bring also represent a conundrum. If
you do nothing, no presents magically materialize under the tree. People have
to actively facilitate this present gathering by shopping for and wrapping
presents themselves, so they quickly realize that "Santa helps those who help
themselves." Jesus encourages pretty much the same behavior in his followers,
but he demands less actual participation in the process. You just have to
believe in him and then "everything happens for a reason" or "it's God's plan."

I think Santa's self sacrificing himself out of existence actually benefits
people more than Jesus' self sacrificing himself on the Cross to purge
humanity's sins (yes, I realize that's Easter, not Xmas). Santa shows people
that you pretty much create your own reality and pull yourself up by your
bootstraps. No mythical being needed. That's a much more empowering message.

Lord Save Us From Your Devotees

Lord.

I know you don't exist. But I am out of options when it comes to the more
extremist of your devotees. Is there any way you can tell them to stop being so
hypocritical and mean to non-believers. It's not cool to wish eternal hellfire
and damnation on others. Even the Bible says so. Sometimes. Other times it says
kill non-believers. It's a really confusing screed, honestly.

A good day to you.
