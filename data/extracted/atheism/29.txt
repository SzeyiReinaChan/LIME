WORDS OF WISDOM

    As an atheist, I am angry that we live in a society in which the plain
    truth cannot be spoken without offending 90% of the population. Sam Harris

    I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing.Richard Feynman

    If [Nazi Germany] was an atheistic regime, then how come, in the first
    chapter of Mein Kampf, Hitler says that he's doing God's work and executing
    God's will in destroying the Jewish people?Christopher Hitchens

    There are today and have been in the past relatively few languages into
    which one can translate the word "religion" — and particularly its plural
    "religions" — outside Western civilization.Wilfred Cantwell Smith

ABOUT THE CHURCH

To promote and advance, as a moral imperative, the unfettered power of thought
over belief, of reason over faith, of facts over revelation and superstition,
and of knowledge over dogmas and doctrines, especially in matters of religion
and religious opinion.
