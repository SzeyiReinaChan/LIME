         "This is the revolution and the evolution beyond the plague,
                   open your eyes and march into the future,
                        stand tall on this new ground,
                  a place purged of ancient ritual and dogma,
                         this is the Atheist Empire."

850,000,000 people around the world are Atheist, Agnostic or Non-Religious.
That's more than 1 out of 10 people, making up the 4th largest belief group.

Statistics have shown that the more educated an individual, the less likely
they are to be religious or believe in a god. 72% of the National Academy of
Sciences members have a 'personal disbelief in god' and another 20% claim
'doubt or agnosticism'.

Less than 1% of the US prison population is 'atheist' vs. about 10% in the
general population.

The Divorce rate among atheists and agnostics is 21% vs. 30% for Jews, 27% for
Born again Christians, and 24% for other Christians. More Atheist Statistics...
