                 UPDATE: The Indiegogo campaign to save SOS is up!
                 Hurry - the campaign ends March 14

                 Dear Friends,

                      As many of you may know, we have been working on a documentary web series
                 for the past two years. This project has been and continues to be an incredible
                 experience for me! The show is called You Are Here TV and is a retrospect on
                 the rapidly growing secular community in Los Angeles. Our new episode explores
                 an incredible organization: SOS (Secular Organizations for Sobriety) and its
                 founder, James Christopher. While in post-production with the episode, it was
                 brought to our attention that SOS will be losing its funding in March of 2014.
                 SOS has been around for over 35 years, boasts meetings all over the world, and
                 has helped countless numbers to get clean and sober. The organization provides
                 a place for alcoholics, addicts, compulsive overeaters and families and friends
                 of alcoholics to go if the spiritual elements of the 12-step model are
                 troublesome for them.

                      You Are Here TV will be launching an Indiegogo campaign for SOS in just a
                 few months, but in the meantime, James Christopher and SOS really need your
                 help. Please watch our mini-doc on this amazing organization, and if you like
                 it, please "Like" it and share it. Help us get the word out about SOS. We need
                 your help!

                      Although the campaign is a few months away, you can still donate to help
                 the SOS cause. Simply visit them on the web at www.sossobriety.org. Or, if you
                 know of anyone who would be willing to help with website re-design and our
                 fundraising efforts, we would love and greatly appreciate your help!

                 THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

                 Cheers!

                 Secular Organizations for Sobriety

                 SOS (also known as Save Our Selves) provides a successful and increasingly
                 popular non-religious alternative to "Twelve Step" recovery programs. In
                 November 1999, SOS launched a series of special events at the Center for
                 Inquiry-L.A.  All SOS events are open to the general public and of course are
                 clean and sober. Light refreshments will be available for purchase. The
                 international headquarters of SOS is housed at the Center for Inquiry-Los
                 Angeles.

                 What is SOS all about?

                 SOS is an alternative recovery method for those alcoholics or drug addicts who
                 are uncomfortable with the spiritual content of widely available 12-Step
                 programs. SOS takes a reasonable, secular approach to recovery and maintains
                 that sobriety is a separate issue from religion or spirituality. SOS credits
                 the individual for achieving and maintaining his or her own sobriety, without
                 reliance on any "Higher Power." Read more here
