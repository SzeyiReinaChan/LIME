Our Mission

Reno Freethinkers provides a friendly community that actively promotes secular
values and critical thinking through social activities, education, and
participation in public affairs and events.

Our Vision

Who We Are

Reno Freethinkers provides a welcoming and safe community to non-believers,
skeptics, humanists, and others who live their lives without supernatural
beliefs.  We come from all walks of life and all positions on the political
spectrum.  We are proponents of science, rationality, open discussion, free
inquiry, freedom of conscience, and sound reasoning about ethical issues. Our
activities include formal meetings, social events and public outreach.

Freedom of Thought

We encourage freedom of thought, unconstrained by authority, tradition,
established belief, prejudice, or dogma.  We promote the use of critical
thinking, reason, empirical evidence, and the scientific method to evaluate all
claims.

Separation of Church and State

We support the Constitution of the United States and the First Amendment
freedoms of all Americans.  We support Thomas Jefferson’s position that the
First Amendment was intended to erect “a wall of separation between church and
state.”

Ethics

We are informed and responsible citizens that strive to build a community that
aspires to reason, logic, and secularism by reinforcing humanistic values. We
promote an ethical moral philosophy that stresses the inherent value of all
people within a free and secular society.

Secular Education

We advocate a secular system of public education for our community. Students
should learn science, critical thinking, and humanistic values.

Community Involvement

We actively seek out opportunities to benefit our communities, such as
assisting local charities, sponsoring food drives, or local clean-ups.  We
engage our media and political leaders on issues of concern to the secular
community. As there is much we share in our common humanity, we are willing
work with the faith community in areas where we share common ground.
