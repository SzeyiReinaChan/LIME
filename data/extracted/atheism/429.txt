Are you a Secular Humanist?

  • Do you think dogmas and ideologies should be tested rather than accepted on
    faith?
  • Do you value freedom of thought, expression and conscience?
  • Are you skeptical of the existence of a supernatural realm?
  • Do you find religion unfulfilling?
  • Do you value religious tolerance and support the separation of church and
    state?
  • Do you embrace the principles of democratic government and universal human
    rights?
  • Do you have a concern for this life and a commitment to making it
    meaningful through increased understanding and compassion?
  • Do you think that morality can exist independent of divine authority?
  • Do you believe that critical thought and the scientific method provide the
    most reliable means of acquiring knowledge?

If you have answered “yes” to these questions, we invite you to learn more
about secular humanism, and the Washington Area Secular Humanists (WASH).
