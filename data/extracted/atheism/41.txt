News of Interest to Deists
A recent survey on religion shows there are 34 million Americans who are
classified as "Nones", that is they do not embrace any of the "revealed"
religions and the vast majority of them are not Atheists. In actuality, the
vast majority of the "Nones" are actually Deists!

The survey shows a giant step forward for Deism in the fact that it actually
uses the word "Deist" and for the very significant raw numbers it shows as
representing the number of people who are Deists.  In reality, the number of
Deists is actually higher than the survey shows because the survey uses an
outdated definition of Deist. For a more accurate definition please see our
Deism Defined page.

Astronomers report a recent study strongly indicates the Universe is infinite.
One of the reasons the freethinker Giordano Bruno was tortured and murdered by
being burned alive by the Catholic Church during the Inquisition was that he
said the Universe is eternal and infinite which violates the superstitions in
the Bible found in Genesis. This new study vindicates Bruno.

Obama is making the mixing of church and state worse than ever before.
Obama supporters forget that when all is said and done, Obama is just another
politician. This article shows he's proving that he is nothing but a politician
by doing more than any other president to mix religion and government,
especially through giving tax-dollars to religious organizations.
