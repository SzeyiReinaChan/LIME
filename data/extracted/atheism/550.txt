"Science has questions that may never be answered, but Religion has Answers
that may never be questioned." ASK!

We're Atheists, Freethinkers and Humanists who meet for weekly Happy Hour at
Barley's Taproom and Pizzeria in the old City.   Mission Statement:  To supply
a venue for Community, Camaraderie, and Outreach to the Rationalists/Atheists
in the Knoxville area.

Our weekly MeetUp is at Barley's Taproom on Tuesdays, for Happy Hour. We're
getting around 25 people every week at our MeetUps!  We're going to need more
tables! :)

Dues are $15/year ($10 for Students and out-of-state) and help to keep ASK
alive and well and support ASK's portion of the Freethought Forum TV show!  
MeetUp.com handles all dues payments through the website. 

Also, be aware that there is also another Rational/Freethought group in
Knoxville.  The Rationalists of East Tennessee (RET) meets Sundays on the
campus of Pellissippi State Community College on Hardin Valley Road.  Visit 
http://www.Rationalists.org for more details.

ASK and RET have been putting on a Community Access Atheist call-in show
"Freethought Forum" for over 5 years now!   Be sure to watch every Tuesday @
5:00 pm on Comcast Channel 12 or streaming on-line on CTVKnox.org!

Remember: If you don't believe in god, you are not alone any longer!
