                              Out of God's Closet
     (Alternately named "Imagine No Superstition" and "No Gods, No Guilt")
                                       
In this exciting book, Out of God's Closet, a former faithful Roman Catholic
priest-become-psychologist shares his inviting journey through agnosticism to
atheism and The 21st Century Golden Rule. Dr. Uhl's Journey was quite unique.
Yet he clearly shows most of us how to get free and drop childhood prejudices
and myths. This can deeply enrich individuals and families throughout our
pluralistic society.
