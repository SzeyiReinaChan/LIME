Ring of Truth (rot) deals with human evolution,
observation and perception. Are we alone? What is our
origin? Is there a destiny? Why should we not consider
that Sciences, Philosophies, Myths and Religions, all    
lead to ONE thing? Should we tolerate the abuse of
religious power to control society? Ring members are
expected to sustain their claims by facts or rational
explanations. You may find some of these pages quite
offensive or bizarre, all are interesting nonetheless.


This is our A_Ring of Truth hubpage. We have 41
carefully chosen sites for you to choose from below. We
hope you'll visit each one!
