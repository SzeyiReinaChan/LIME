Why join a secular student group?

We welcome and desire members from all beliefs and backgrounds, and we're
definitely not a group just for nonbelievers. We think it's incredibly
important to consider the views of others in an attempt to understand one
another. We know that it is easy to jump to conclusions, rather than see past
shallow differences to our common humanity, so it's up to us to cultivate a
sense of patience and respect.

We want members who are committed participants, who seeks to live a life marked
by intellectual growth, emotional resilience, compassionate action, and wonder.

So, why join our group? If you're the kind of person who wants to make the
world a better place, we want to meet you. And if you're a person who wants to
spread goodness, we have the group for you.

How do we start?

College is just one stop on the road of life, and it's a time of great
possibilities—so why not make the most of your time here? First, we need to
intentionally build a supportive community. We want to help you strengthen your
emotional and intellectual resiliency with the help of others for a lifetime of
benefits. That's why we created our Waypoint groups.

Our Waypoint groups are opportunities to examine and question ideas from all of
human culture, to make friends and connect as a group in a safe space free of
criticism, and to build ourselves and our community up. These groups are
intentional gatherings of students who commit themselves to work together to
make the world a better place.
