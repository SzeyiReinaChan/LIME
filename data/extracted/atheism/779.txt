About CASH

The best damned group on campus since 1991!

Campus Atheists, Skeptics, and Humanists (formerly Campus Atheists and Secular
Humanists) is a registered student organization at the University of Minnesota.
We strive to create a community for atheist, agnostic, humanist, and other
freethinking individuals. Attendance and membership are open to the public and
encouraged amongst students and the community, regardless of religious or
political ascriptions.

What We Do

CASH has a three-part mission statement:

Community – End the isolation experienced by nontheists by fostering a socially
and intellectually engaging community.
Education – Advance the knowledge of the University community by contributing
to the marketplace of ideas.
Advocacy– Promote tolerance and understanding; address negative stereotyping,
misconceptions about, and discrimination against nontheists.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Why We Do It

The University of Minnesota’s sociology department found, in their “American
Mosaic Project” survey, that atheists are America’s most distrusted minority.
The study notes that the general trend of increasing tolerance of religious
diversity does not extend to those with no religion. CASH provides a “safe
harbor” for this often-overlooked minority. Many CASH members come to the U
from small towns where the church is the center of community life and any
critical discussion of faith is taboo; these people particularly value the
community we create.

How We Do It

CASH co-sponsors panels, speakers, and workshops with a diverse array of faith
groups on campus, including the Muslim Student Association (MSA), the Hindu
Student Society (HSS), Mars Hill Students, Christian Believers On Campus
(CBOC), Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC), the University Pagan Society, Hillel,
the Interfaith Student Partnership, the Diamond Way Buddhist Meditation Group,
Baha’i Association (BA), Intervarsity Christian Fellowship, University
Unitarian Universalists, the Queer Student Cultural Center (QSCC), SHADE,
al-Madinah Cultural Center, and MacLaurin CSF. Our co-sponsored events are
aimed at promoting understanding and tolerance, encouraging dialogue about
faith and reason, and educating the campus community about various worldviews.
CASH also sponsors numerous lectures and other educational and social events of
interest to the entire campus community. Topics include religion, culture,
history, philosophy, science, and politics.
