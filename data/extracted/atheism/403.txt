                       About Our Group
                        

                       East Bay Atheists meets each month in the Berkeley main library to discuss
                       atheism and other topical events of interests to atheists. Our collective
                       mission includes local activism when "freethinkers" rights to be free from
                       religion are threatened, or when government promotes religion.

                        

                       Who is an Atheist
                        

                       An Atheist is one who has no belief in or knowledge of any god/gods. We want to
                       live a religion-free life. We promote our US Constitutional right of freedom
                       from religion. We do not want our taxes supporting religion or faith-based
                       organizations. We invite fellow Atheists to join us in peacefully promoting our
                       principles and protecting our rights.
