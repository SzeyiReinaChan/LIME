    If Jesus existed today wouldn&#039;t he be a democrat?

    If Jesus existed today wouldn't he be a democrat?

    He fought against the traditional values of the roman empire, gave out free
    health care everywhere he went, and preached giving to the poor and needy.

    just once a year?

    Does ignore the prayers of hungry children?

    God once rained magic bread from the sky, this kid is eating garbage off
    the the ground. I'm not a nutritionist but I think that magic bread is
    better than garbage. Why doesn't god rain magic bread to feed the millions
    of starving children, or was that a one time deal?

    Why do people that don't like faith/religion/spirituality spend so much
    time in the R&S section bashing people over what they believe?

    If they don't like faith/religion/spirituality, why are they spending so
    much time in an R&S section doing these things, if it is not for the hatred
    they have built up in themselves which they are trying to pour on others
    (but doing more damage to themselves in the process)?

    What is it that stops a religious person from seeing the truth in this
    image?

    What is it that stops a religious person from seeing the truth in this
    image?

    Best answer: Yes religious indoctrination is very very strong. A person can
    completely deny the growing mountain of evidence that supports evolution
    and totally 100% believe in talking snakes.

    There is not a form of brainwashing in existence that can compete with
    this.

    I'm a Christian but just got more into it and I'm more spiritual and
    philosophical about it. Anyway I have been kinda confused about
    homosexuality in the bible, it condems it in Levicitus 20:13 and
    Corinthians 6:9-10 but what about Matthew 19:11-12, eunchs are homosexuals.
    But what if you repent about being gay or talk to God about it. What about
    if he made you gay like if you knew from early childhood or adolescent.

    Atheists, how do you feel about the scientific method being created by
    Christians?

    Almost all of the modern first world comforts you enjoy are due to the
    innovation of christians and all of your rights and privileges were won by
    christians spilling blood in wars. Kind of challenges the "new atheist"
    rhetoric that religion is pure evil and the cause of every problem in
    history.
