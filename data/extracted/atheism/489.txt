The Smartest Atheists in Town

Calling oneself an “Atheist” is just the beginning, not the end, of a life-long
journey of learning, dialog and discovery. The Atheist Scholars Meetup group
raises the standard among local Atheist groups by building a private membership
focused on learning, harmony and friendship. This is a new local alternative
for discerning Atheists. Maybe you have been reluctant to join an Atheist group
in the past or maybe you are not interested what the other groups have to
offer.

If you call yourself an Atheist, are a life-long learner who is not gullible
enough to believe in conspiracy theories, and you see the benefits of a Meetup
group offering lectures, order and civility, please apply for membership in
Atheist Scholars. By “Scholars,” we mean serious students of Atheism. This is
an exclusive, lecture-based Meetup for select Atheists interested in learning
in a friendly and supportive atmosphere. This group is all Atheism, all the
time. It’s for new and old Atheists alike who want to learn more in a private
classroom setting guided by an experienced teacher.

Atheist Scholars hold monthly educational lectures using an Atheist Studies
curriculum while building long-term, harmonious friendships among those whom we
respect. You are invited to apply for membership by clicking on the link below.
All meetings are held in Royal Oak the 4th Tuesday of every month, 7 to 10 pm.
Annual membership dues are $25. Attendance at the majority of lectures is
required. Website lurkers are not allowed.

The curriculum has been developed by our instructor, Mary C. Taylor, to raise
the standard of knowledge among Atheists. Mary has developed new adult
education classes in Atheism. Our Meetup message board is organized and
moderated by Jim Taylor.

Atheist Scholars is for those who appreciate the value of group learning led by
a legitimate authority in an organized fashion. It is for serious students of
Atheism who enjoy asking “why” more than claiming to know “because.” It’s for
committed life-long learners looking for an impressive group of friendly
Atheists. If you want to see some of our curriculum, go to our public website
at www.AtheistScholar.org.

This is an exclusive Meetup group. All members must apply and be approved
unanimously by the Organizer and two Assistant Organizers.

Annual dues are $25. Attendance at four of the six meetings in a six-month
period is required.
