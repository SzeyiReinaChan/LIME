  • What they're saying...

    Jesus & Mo (the characters) are absurd, blinkered, and oddly very sweet. J&
    M (the cartoon) is brilliant: sharp, delicious, irresistible. 
    Salman Rushdie

    Jesus and Mo cartoons are wonderfully funny and true. 
    Richard Dawkins

    Jesus and Mo make the world a better place, bless their little hearts.   
    Ophelia Benson

    In a world defined by outrage and offence and liberal spinelessness, Jesus
    and Mo is a treasure, whose value we should never fail to recognize. Read
    them. Laugh. And think. 
    Kenan Malik

    ...a philosophical confre`re.   
    Jerry Coyne

    The brilliant, celebrated, freaking hilarious atheist comic strip ...  
    Greta Christina

    ...rays of sanity in a befuddled world.  
    Keri Hulme

    The liveliest depictions of Muhammad currently available... 
    Malise Ruthven

    J & Mo is the funniest and most consistently thought-provoking cartoon
    strip on the Net. In a saner world, it would run in a major newspaper. 
    Nelson Jones, Heresy Corner

    Consistently amusing, frequently thought-provoking and often heart-warming.
     
    New Humanist

    Jesus & Mo is one of the most wonderful things on the internet.. 
    JT Eberhard

    Wittily captures much of the absurdity of religious apologetics. 
    Mano Singham

    ...wonderfully brilliant and witty. 
    Miranda Celeste Hale

    Too good for words. 
    Maryam Namazie

    The Eric and Ernie of monotheism. 
    Tom Holland

    The most impious double act since Sodom and Gomorrah. 
    Andrew Copson, Chief Executive, BHA

    I love jesusandmo.net cartoons - witty and sharp! 
    Katha Pollitt

    Often hilarious, frequently wry, these cartoons do what all the best
    cartoons do: they tell the truth through humour. 
    Terry Sanderson, NSS President

    ...a wonderfully acid British cartoonist... 
    Nick Cohen

    I love the scrappy mockery of Jesus and Mo. Freedom of speech includes the
    freedom to mock any person, any thing, any activity, and any belief -- and
    J&M stands up for this unflinchingly 
    Richard Stallman

    ...empowering, important and deeply progressive, not to mention
    hilarious... 
    Council of Ex-Muslims

    ...humor is humor and this cartoonist doesn't have it.    Karl Giberson
