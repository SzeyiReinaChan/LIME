This site is open to all who identify with the title atheist, agnostic,
freethinker, Humanist, Bright, or basically anyone who can not say
categorically that they believe in a transcendental super-being.

From monthly business meetings and social gatherings to radio webcasts and
science field trips, from bowling leagues and movie nights to charity
fundraisers and community activism, there is something here for everyone in our
vibrant and growing secular community...

Any member can suggest a meetup, and if there is enough interest, it will be
scheduled....Come Join the Fun!

 This page is administered and paid for by SWiFT.  SWiFT reserves the right of
