Do you question the existence of God? Is religion not fulfilling? Do you think
you are an atheist or agnostic, but see atheism and agnosticism as negative
only? Then check out Secular Humanism, the POSITIVE ALTERNATIVE. We have
regular study groups so people can learn more about humanism. Join us to learn
more. Check out www.kcfreethought.org for information about other humanist and
free thought events.
