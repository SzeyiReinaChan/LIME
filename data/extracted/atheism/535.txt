Welcome to PSF!  If you're looking for a sense of community, or if you just
want to meet some like-minded friends--people who think outside the box when it
comes to life--we are your group.

One-fifth of American adults--and one-third of Americans under 30--have no
religious affiliation. Secularism is growing, but freethinkers are still a
minority, and it can be sobering to pursue a well-informed world view.  This
group is a place for freethinkers of all kinds to discuss our viewpoints and
make connections with like-minded people.  Join us for open discussions about
our place in the universe and how we might create positive change in our world.

We host regular discussion groups, social events, ladies' meetups, and
volunteering events--and we are part of a larger secular community in
Pittsburgh that has lots of great events.

Freethought is a philosophical viewpoint that opinions should be formed on the
basis of science, logic, and reason, and should not be influenced by authority,
tradition, or dogma.

Secularism is the idea that people, governments, and other entities should have
the right to be free from religious rule and teachings or to be neutral in
regard to matters of belief.

Atheism ("a" + "theism") means a rejection of belief in the existense of a god
or gods.  It can also refer to the belief that there are no deities.  Most
inclusively, atheism is simply the absence of belief that deities of any kind
exist. Some atheists refer to themselves as "non-theists." 

Agnostics separate out belief from actual knowledge.  They think it is
impossible or not currently possible to prove the existence or non-existence of
any deity, creative force, or other religious belief.  Agnosticism may also
refer to having a skeptical approach to such questions.

Deists believe that observation and reason suggest the existence of a higher
power, but stop short of proclaiming that we know who or what is responsible
for the wonders of the universe. We don't yet know, and may never know.

Humanists believe all humans have the ability and responsibility to lead
ethical lives that aspire to the greater good of humanity. They are committed
to diversity, equality, an open and secular society, and to protecting the
integrity and sustainability of our planet's resources.

Naturalism is the viewpoint that the laws of nature, as opposed to supernatural
laws, are all that operate in the universe.  Steve Irwin, Rachel Carson,
Charles Darwin, and Beatrix Potter were all naturalists.

Whether or not we use these labels, we endorse the exploration of our world
through science, rational thought, and evidence-based methods.  We embrace free
inquiry, skepticism, and critical thinking.

People of all faiths and non-faiths are welcome to join us for conversation and
philosophic exploration.  We welcome everyone!

*PSF is also affiliated with The Center for Inquiry–Pittsburgh, and with the
Pittsburgh Coalition of Reason.  CFI sponsors local events to create a thriving
community based on science, secularism, and Humanist values. Programming
includes social events, discussion groups, and lectures designed to encourage
free thought, critical thinking, and community activism. Learn more at:
