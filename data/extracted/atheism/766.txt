  • funny bits – that keep on coming – one a day – sort of – (many of which are
    on tshirts, mugs, fridge magnets, etc in my cafepress shop)


                                                                      4/14/2015

    A church group at the University of Texas is promoting Christian faith as
    the best way to avoid abduction by aliens.

    Well yeah. Any aliens that come here won’t be that stupid.

    (Then again, any aliens that come here–)


                                                                      11/8/2014

    Investigators of yet another stigmata “miracle” discovered that the red
    stuff seeping from the wounds of a crucified Christ figure was indeed
    genuine human blood.

    Wouldn’t that cast doubt – on the ‘son of a god’ thing?


                                                                      8/18/2014

    Why did the guardian angel cross the road?

    To be with his imaginary friend.


                                                                      7/29/2014

    Men who think size matters are usually – fat.


                                                                      6/23/2014

    On a regular basis, men enter a ring and punch each other repeatedly in the
    head.

    This causes brain damage.

    Well, more brain damage.

    Critics are reminded that the participants are consenting adults.

    That’s the part we don’t get.


                                                                      5/20/2014

    In our society, girls still get the impression that men as a whole are
    better than women. After all, they’re the presidents and the CEOs and even
    the supervisors.

    But when you raise a girl to believe that all men are better than her, you
    raise her to date, have sex with, fall in love with, and marry any old
    asshole. Because even he knows more, can do more, can do better –

    Oh. That’s why girls are still led to believe that men as a whole are
    better than women.


                                                                       5/3/2014

    When there’s a train wreck or something, survivors often attribute their
    good fortune to God. They walk around saying “It’s a miracle! Praise the
    Lord!”

    That happened to me once. I was driving back from a business meeting with
    my pompous little shit of a supervisor and we got into a three-car pile-up.
    He was killed instantly and I said the same thing – “It’s a miracle! Praise
    the Lord!”


                                                                      4/13/2014

    Did you hear about that Amish kid who got caught reading porn?

    His parents confiscated his entire collection of Car & Driver and Popular
    Mechanics.


                                                                       4/7/2014

    You know what women like about their periods? They’re regular. They’re
    every 28 days, give or take.

    Wouldn’t it be nice if men knew when they were being taken over by their
    chemicals?


                                                                      3/22/2014

    I applaud the idea of god as a woman.

    It’s a sure-fire way to make “him” non-existent.

    Or at least totally inconsequential.


                                                                      3/13/2014

    Anti-gun law advocate and pastor of the New Life Christian Fellowship,
    Herbert Kershaw, accidentally shot himself to death while demonstrating gun
    safety to his family.

    [And I just now realized the second way in which that’s funny.]


                                                                      2/24/2014

    Who was Cain’s wife?

    If it was Eve, then we’re the result of inbreeding all the way back.

    Which, now that I think of it, explains a lot.

    And if it was someone else – who created her?


                                                                      2/12/2014

    I don’t understand all the anger about discontinuing “The Prayer” in
    schools, courtrooms, council meetings, and other public places.

    We’re not trying to stop you from praying wherever and whenever you want –
    we’d just rather you not be such an exhibitionist about it.


                                                                       2/3/2014

    Those people who become ‘born again’?

    I guess that’s one way to avoid growing up.


                                                                      1/28/2014

    So I was talking to some non-practising Catholics the other day.

    Told them I was a non-practising saint.


                                                                       1/5/2014

    The Road Trip Dialogues – free for a limited time!

    (yeah, yeah, trying out a promotional strategy)


                                                                     12/28/2013

    Speaking of which, the Pope says that if a man with HIV can’t abstain from
    intercourse, it’s better that he infect his wife than use a condom.

    And I say that if a woman with PMS can’t resist a rage, it’s better that
    she gun down the Pope than take a Midol.


                                                                     12/19/2013

    Speaking of creation, if God made everything, who made God?

    If he just always was, then why couldn’t it be that everything else just
    always was?

    And if he made himself, well, I guess that means he can go fuck himself!


                                                                      12/6/2013

    It seems to me God’s a little obsessed with sex – so many stories in The
    Bible involve rape, incest, whoring, lust, coveting thy neighbour’s wife,
    deflowering virgins…

    He’s also a little obsessed with food – what to eat, when to eat.

    Guess that’s what happens when you’re non-corporeal.


                                                                      12/2/2013

    Or maybe he just lies a lot.

    He promised Jacob that he would return from Egypt (Gen 46:3,4), but he
    didn’t – he died there (Gen 49).

    So it would seem that ‘God said so!’ is not exactly a solid claim to
    legitimacy.


                                                                     11/22/2013

    Or could be he’s just wrong a lot.

    He said that Adam would die on the day he ate the apple (Gen 2:16,17), but
    he didn’t (Gen 3:17; Gen 5:3).

    He told Jehoiakim that he wouldn’t have a son (Jer 36:30), but he did (2
    Kgs 24:6).


                                                                     11/15/2013

    Or maybe he just changes his mind a lot.

    Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; no, wait, ye shall
    not eat of them that chew the cud or of them that divide the cloven hoof.
    (Gen 9:3; Deut 14:7)


                                                                      11/7/2013

    Ye are saved through grace, not works. (Eph 2:8,9) By works a man is
    justified. (Jas 2:24)

    I am a jealous God visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
    unto the third and fourth generations. (Ex 20:5) The son shall not bear the
    iniquity of the father. (Ezek 18:20)

    Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you. (Jn 14:27) Think not that
    I am come to send peace on earth. (Mt 10:34)

    Israel shall rise again. (Jer 31:4) Israel shall not rise again. (Amos 5:2)

    I guess they’re right – God does transcend the laws of logic.


                                                                      11/1/2013

    I used to be pissed because none of Christ’s disciples were women.

    Then I realized what a sorry lot of gullible schmucks they were, traipsing
    along after a total stranger, leaving at a moment’s notice their families,
    their jobs – “Hey, come follow me! I’m a god! No, really! Look – there,
    that bush – I did that! I set it on fire! Aren’t I some kind of wonderful?”


                                                                     10/25/2013

    According to Roman Catholics, thanks to Eve, and our forbidden-fruit
    knowledge of good and evil, we’re born sinners.

    So what, blessed are the psychopaths?


                                                                     10/18/2013

    There’s something fundamentally wrong with prayer.

    It doesn’t work.


                                                                     10/11/2013

    At the gas station, I saw a couple guys on their way to their hunt camp.

    “How many squares did ya bring?” the one asked the other.

    A case of 24 bottles of beer is not square. It’s rectangular.

    And God help us, they’re the ones with all the spatial ability.


                                                                      10/4/2013

    Don’t leafblowers make an awful noise? It’s such an irritating whine.

    You know why, dontcha? Because they were made for men – by men.

    That’s probably why the damned things don’t even really clean up the
    leaves, they just move the mess from one place to another.


                                                                      9/24/2013

    Why did God forbid knowledge of good and evil?

    Could it be he didn’t want us to know what an evil messed up sonuvabitch he
    was?

    (Given that he proceeded to order mass murders left, right, and center –
    the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the
    Perizzites, the Hivites, the Jebusites, and the entire cities of Makkadah,
    Libnah, Lachish, Gezer, Eglon, and Hebron – and we still think he’s
    overflowing with love and kindness, he obviously didn’t have anything to
    worry about.)


                                                                      9/18/2013

    According to The Bible (2 Sam 23:8,18; 1 Chr 11:11), some guy named Adino
    killed 800 men in a single battle, and Abishai and Jashobeam each killed
    300.

    Who were these guys? Even if that single battle lasted a full 24 hours,
    that’s at least 12 killed per hour. Which is one every five minutes.

    Now I’ve never killed a person, with just knives and swords and shit, but
    it can’t be that easy.

    One guy every five minutes for 24 hours straight?

    So inquiring minds have to ask: when these guys went fishing, did they ever
    catch anything? Yeah? How big? (Thanks to Farrell Till.)


                                                                      9/12/2013

    And Moses. God gave him the Top Ten Commandments, all engraved in stone
    yet, but he didn’t give him a lousy map.

    He knew he wouldn’t stop and ask for directions.


                                                                       9/5/2013

    And O Creator of Everything, how can you not once even mention DNA?

    (Not in Genesis, not in Revelation…)


                                                                      8/30/2013

    Chapter 28 of Deuteronomy says that if we don’t hearken unto God’s voice,
    he’s going to smite us with consumption, fever, inflammation, burning,
    hemorrhoids, the scab, the itch, and the botch of Egypt.

    Oh no! The botch of Egypt!


                                                                      8/23/2013

    Catholics believe in the doctrine of ‘original sin’: just by being born, we
    bring sin into the world.

    So shouldn’t they approve of abortion?


                                                                      8/17/2013

    Their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall
    be ripped up. (Hos 13:16)

    Dash their children, and rip up their women with child. (2 Kgs 8:12).

    Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the
    stones. (Ps 137:9)

    They shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb. (Isa 13:18)

    Thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body. (Deut 28:53)

    So I guess God’s not really Pro-Life then, is he.


                                                                      8/11/2013

    For the record, I don’t become bitchy for a few days a month.

    I develop a heightened sensitivity to your many flaws.


                                                                      7/28/2013

    How a Dog is Not Like a Kid

    1. A dog is generally kept on a leash when in public.

    2. When a kid gets tired in public, it whines and tugs and whines – instead
    of quietly curling up and falling asleep. At your feet.

    3. A dog can be ‘toilet-trained’ in a week or two.

    4. A dog doesn’t bark nearly as much as a kid cries, screams, wails, and
    shrieks. And it will seldom wake up in the middle of the night for just
    that very purpose.

    5. A dog sits on command. And comes when you call.

    6. A dog usually gets spayed and neutered before it reaches puberty.

    7. A dog’s destructive period generally lasts about a year. Not ten.
    (Thirty, in the case of males.)

    8. And yet hotels, motels, apartments, and condos are far more likely to
    have a ‘No Dogs’ rule than a ‘No Kids’ rule. And those that allow kids
    don’t have a weight limit.


                                                                      7/21/2013

    Studies show that people with mentors advance in their careers more than
    those without mentors.

    See, I’ve never had a mentor.

    ‘Course, I’ve never had a career.


                                                                      7/15/2013

    So I was looking for a job, and everyone kept saying “You’re
    overqualified.”

    Yeah, well, the jobs I’m qualified for are filled.

    By men.


                                                                       7/9/2013

    “I mean, we protect you,” he continued, “you benefit from our defence.”

    Yeah right. Like the safest place to be is right beside the jerk who’s
    mouthing off and waving a big fat gun. Right beside the asshole everyone
    wants to just sit down and shut the fuck up.


                                                                       7/5/2013

    An American told me once that they considered taking certain action against
    Canada, as revenge for not supporting them in one of their wars. “But,” he
    explained, “we sort of consider Canada our little brother, you know?”

    Revenge for not supporting them? Who’s the little brother?


                                                                      6/23/2013

    People who need people are – codependent.


                                                                      6/12/2013

    Pitch for a sci-fi movie: A plague kills all the women on Earth except
    five, who manage to escape infection. On these five depend the continuation
    of the human species.

    And when the men find them, it takes all of fifteen minutes to rape them to
    death.

    (A very short sci-fi movie.)


                                                                       6/3/2013

    What’s scary about the development of intelligent computers or biochemical
    roots is not that they might some day pass whatever test we come up with to
    determine if they meet the criteria for being a conscious human being.

    What’s scary is that on that day, a good number of the rest of us might
    not.


                                                                      5/24/2013

    I guess there’s nothing wrong with believing there’s life after death.

    Unless, of course, you’re my surgeon!


                                                                      5/20/2013

    Chapter 2 of Kings says that God arranged to have 42 children killed by
    bears because they teased a bald guy.

    I betcha God’s bald.


                                                                      5/16/2013

    Research continues to show that the older you get, the less likely you are
    to get married.

    Well yeah. Because the older you get, the less likely you are to be
    deluded.


                                                                      5/13/2013

    I once saw three big fish in a teeny little front yard pond.

    Must’ve taken a whole two seconds for Bob to swim from one end to the
    other, passing Harry, and back, passing Joe.

    I sure hope all three have that short-term memory thing where you can’t
    remember what you just did.


                                                                       5/9/2013

    One of the biggest problems facing humanity today is how to get rid of the
    men. I have the solution. We turn them into women.

    Most of them will then kill themselves, unable to deal with their new
    subordinate status.


                                                                       5/3/2013

    I read the other day about the new proposed crime, “negligent rape”, in
    which a man fails to notice a woman’s lack of consent.

    Guys. How can you fail to notice “GET THE FUCK OFF ME!”?


                                                                      4/26/2013

    It’s always pissed me off how men seem to make every little thing they do
    so important. They put on such a serious face. Even if they’re just tying
    their shoelaces.

    Turns out I’ve been giving them way too much credit. They’re not conveying
    importance. They’re just concentrating really really hard.


                                                                      4/19/2013

    I was reading the other day about cave art, how there are a lot more
    pictures of animals drawn in profile and than in frontal view. Apparently
    because the frontal view is a sophisticated perspective requiring cognitive
    skills present only in more evolved brains.

    There’s a simpler explanation. The guys who actually saw a woolly mammoth
    head-on? They died.


                                                                      4/13/2013

    According to Biblical accounts, God’s commanded the deaths of 185,000
    Assyrians, 120,000 Midianites, 120,000 Judeans, 100,000 Syrians, 24,000
    Israelites, and 10,000 Moabites.

    Now, he’s obviously rounding off to the nearest thousand, and I have to
    tell you, that lack of attention to detail bothers me.


                                                                       4/7/2013

    “Y’know why women can’t play poker?” this guy asked me once.

    “’Cuz they’re no good at bluffing.”

    Well, I guess you’ve never had sex with a woman then, eh?


                                                                       4/3/2013

    George Carlin with Tourette’s Syndrome:

    “Republican! Priest!”


                                                                      3/26/2013

    The Bible continues to appear on bestseller lists even though the plot is
    repetitious, the characters are unlikeable, the dialogue, unrealistic, and
    the tone, juvenile.

    And much of it just fucking doesn’t make sense: “Wherefore my sentence is,
    that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God”
    (Acts 15:19). What?


                                                                      3/21/2013

    All those women in tv ads that are so happy that their eyelashes can now be
    ultra-curled, ultra-lengthened, and ultra-thickened — if my eyes were that
    vacant, I sure wouldn’t want to draw attention to them.

    No wait a minute. If I were that vacant — I guess I would.


                                                                      3/14/2013

    Have you seen those extra large chocolate bars with the re-sealable
    packages?

    Why would you need a re-sealable package on a chocolate bar?


                                                                       3/9/2013

    Who came up with the name ‘Viagra’?

    I guess it’s supposed to sound like ‘Niagara’.

    But it’s ‘Niagara Falls‘.

    Better to have chosen ‘Geyser’.

    ‘Course that sounds too much like ‘Geezer’.

    They should’ve just gone with ‘Hamburger Helper’.


                                                                       3/4/2013

    Have you seen that show “Dogs with Jobs”?

    I’ve got a companion show to pitch.  “Cats on Unemployment.”


                                                                       3/1/2013

    At every age over fifteen, more women than men receive treatment for mental
    health problems.

    Scarey, eh? All those men walking around out there – untreated.


                                                                      2/18/2013

    High school sucked, didn’t it.

    And those were the best years of our lives.


                                                                      2/14/2013

    They say curiosity killed the cat.

    Maybe the first eight times.

    The ninth time? That had to’ve been stupidity.


                                                                      2/10/2013

    Got a donation request the other day from the Alzheimers’ Society.

    And I was actually gonna write out a cheque.

    But then I – forgot.


                                                                       2/6/2013

    The companies putting CFCs into the atmosphere, wrecking the ozone, and
    giving us all skin cancer?

    Serve us right if they were all owned by rich black people.


                                                                       2/1/2013

    Someone once told me that the virus is the only life form that requires a
    higher life form in order to replicate.

    They obviously forgot about men.


                                                                      1/25/2013

    A group of hunters is protesting elk farms.

    Because they’re unethical.

    Right.

    They’re just pissed because the farmers are taking away their fun.

    Well, fair’s fair.

    I say let the cows loose.


                                                                      1/20/2013

    The word ‘wife’ first referred to those women who were captured, after the
    invasion and conquest of a neighbouring tribe, and brought home to be
    slaves. ‘To have and to hold’ is in fact a legal expression used to
    transfer possession of a piece of property.

    In Canada, one in four wives is severely beaten during the course of the
    marriage; half of all wife assault victims are kicked in the abdomen when
    pregnant; and almost sixty percent of the women who are murdered are
    murdered by their husbands. And yet, get this: ninety-four percent of all
    women consent to get married.


                                                                      1/15/2013

    Ya gotta love automated answering systems.

    Press 1 for sales, 2 for service, and 3 if you have no short-term memory
    whatsoever.


                                                                      1/11/2013

    Heard this guy say the other day that women can’t do jobs that involve
    heavy machinery.

    What do you guys do with it all day – carry it?

    Got one word for you: forklift.


                                                                       1/8/2013

    That ‘don’t-ask-don’t-tell’ thing the military has going?

    How can they face the enemy if they can’t even face homosexuality?


                                                                       1/4/2013

    Ever see two snails chasing each other?


                                                                     12/30/2012

    I heard someone say the other day say “Wouldn’t it be great if we could
    travel through time?”

    Hello. We travel from yesterday to today – every day.


                                                                     12/26/2012

    So my Christmas gift for my nephew was apparently “inappropriate”.

    Explain to me why toy guns are okay, but toy thumbscrews are considered
    sick?


                                                                     12/19/2012

    Have you heard –- armies use radioactive bullets.

    Guess when you get hit, you glow in the dark.

    So much for that brand new camouflage outfit.


                                                                     12/13/2012

    So deer season was a couple weeks ago.  I saw some guy standing in the bush
    a few metres off the road, waiting, rifle ready.

    “You’re not gonna kill the mom and two little fawns we see around here, are
    you?” I asked.

    “Oh, we’ll try not to!” he smiled.

    What’s to try?  Unload the gun.

    If that’s too tricky, just put it down.

    Dumfucks.


                                                                      12/7/2012

    Each year, 100 men kill their female partners, but only 3 women kill their
    male partners.

    I figure hey – there’s a market potential for assertiveness training
    seminars.


                                                                     11/26/2012

    How many philosophers does it take to change a light bulb?

    Define ‘light bulb’.


                                                                     11/22/2012

    How do you turn a rainforest into a desert?

    Eat a hamburger.


                                                                     11/19/2012

    What’s another word for unannounced nuclear test?

    Accident.


                                                                     11/15/2012

    Why is Aunt Jemima a maid and Uncle Ben a chef?

    And Mr. Clean – yeah right.


                                                                      11/6/2012

    Speaking of washrooms, I was in one the other day. A women’s washroom. In
    one of the government buildings.

    And as I was in one of the stalls, I happened to read the little sign on
    that little box. It said “For your convenience, a sanitary receptacle is
    provided in this cubicle. You are requested to co-operate and use it for
    the purpose intended.”

    I’m still coming up with alternate uses for those things.


                                                                      11/3/2012

    Why did the paranoic cross the road?

    Why do you ask?


                                                                     10/30/2012

    Why did the multiple personality cross the road?

    Are you asking me?


                                                                     10/29/2012

    Why did the hallucinating person cross the road?

    To follow the chicken.


                                                                     10/27/2012

    Why did the masochist cross the road?

    He didn’t. Because the grass was greener.


                                                                     10/25/2012

    Why did the delusional person cross the road?

    Because he thought the grass was greener on the other side.


                                                                     10/22/2012

    Why did the passive personality cross the road?

    Because I told him to.


                                                                     10/12/2012

    Did you know there’s an international law that says you can’t use weapons
    that cause “unnecessary suffering”?

    Blowing your right leg off, that was necessary.

    But the left leg, gee, I’m sorry about that, that was unnecessary, wasn’t
    it.


                                                                      10/9/2012

    According to Manly Palmer Hall, “We are all healthy when we are not
    thinking about ourselves.”

    Speak for yourself.

    I’m not such a basket case that I can’t bear the thought of me.


                                                                      10/4/2012

    Isn’t it amazing what biological research is doing for agriculture?

    We have nectarines – a peach without the fuzz.

    And seedless grapes – that must have been a trick.

    And now “boneless chicken”.

    Wouldn’t that make life in the barnyard a little difficult?


                                                                      10/1/2012

    Women, don’t you just hate having PMS? Being all irritable and angry for a
    few days each month.

    But hey, at least we’re not men.

    They have PMS all month long.

    It’s called testosterone.

    The guy on the freeway leaning on his horn and slamming into you? That’s
    not road rage, that’s a man with PMS.

    And football and hockey, all those guys smashing into each other? Guys with
    PMS.

    And war?! They’re killing each other. I wish they’d just take their Midol
    already.


                                                                      9/28/2012

    Jack and Jill went up the hill

    To fetch a pail of water

    Jack fell down and broke his crown

    And Jill said, “Clumsy!”


                                                                      9/22/2012

    I was reading the other day about this guy, Daniel Maston, an assistant
    operator at the Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station. He was sentenced
    to four months for spiking the cafeteria’s juice cooler with tritiated
    heavy water from the reactor.

    Apparently he said –- and I quote –- “I don’t have a good reason. I just
    did it. Maybe it was a joke.”

    And we worry about terrorists stealing plutonium.


                                                                      9/17/2012

    How many students does it take to change a light bulb?

    ‘That’s the janitor’s job, let him do it, he’s getting paid.’


                                                                      9/14/2012

    Speaking of perpetual hard-ons, you know how they’re always saying they
    can’t control it?

    Yeah right. They control 94% of the planet’s property, 96% of its politics,
    and 98% of its money.

    But they just cannot control their own penises.


                                                                      9/12/2012

    I saw a book the other day titled Sex Can Make You Stupid.

    I laughed, but you know it’s true, isn’t it? Whenever I get really horny, I
    do stupid things. Really stupid things.

    And then I thought, you know how men are always telling us they’ve got this
    perpetual hard-on? Well.


                                                                       9/6/2012

    For most of us, loss is the difference between what you have at Time 1 and
    what you have at Time 2: yesterday, I had ten marbles; today, I have seven;
    so I lost a few – three, to be exact.

    However, those in business define loss as the difference between what you
    get and what you might’ve gotten. So if they get ten marbles and they think
    they could’ve gotten a hundred, they ‘suffer a loss’ of ninety marbles.

    Which means, by their own reckoning, they’ve lost quite a few more marbles
    than the rest of us.


                                                                      8/31/2012

    Saw another ad, for a food demonstrator.

    “Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please? This – is food.”


                                                                      8/30/2012

    “Heard you were ill, injured, whatever –- Can I borrow your car this
    weekend?”


                                                                      8/27/2012

    “I’m sorry we fought last night. I’m much more vicious during the day.”


                                                                      8/21/2012

    Saw an ad for a poet for a greeting card company. Even submitted a
    portfolio.

    “You light up my life. Like an oncoming train.”


                                                                      8/13/2012

    Now that the Olympics are over, I’d like to point out that there are
    several sports in which we haven’t yet reached our full potential.

    In water polo, as in regular polo, there should be horses involved.

    In the sculls, they should narrow the lanes and let the competitors whack
    their opponents out of their boats.

    In the steeplechase, in that pool of water at that last hurdle? We should
    put a crocodile in there.

    The flimsy crossbar of the pole vault should be replaced with a sturdy
    two-by-four. Nailed in place.

    And in the relay, instead of a baton, the runners should have to pass off a
    chicken.


                                                                      8/12/2012

    It occurs to me that there are a few sports we just haven’t named very
    well.

    Squash is not played with a squash.

    There are no fences in fencing, no rugs in rugby.

    And ‘the butterfly’ – have you ever seen what happens to a butterfly in
    water?


                                                                      8/11/2012

    And you know, I don’t think the Olympic marathoners are all that
    impressive. You’ll notice that most of them are done in two, two-and-a-half
    hours.

    I’ve run a marathon and I can tell you for a fact that I can keep going for
    another two hours. At least.


                                                                      8/11/2012

    Have you noticed that the distance running events are almost always won by
    someone from Kenya, Ethiopia, or some other starving country?

    See what you can do when all you’ve got to carry around is skin-and-bones?


                                                                      8/10/2012

    Did you know they once tried a men’s synchronized swimming team?

    One guy got pissed off at another guy, and then another guy got involved,
    next thing you know, half the team’s dead in the water.

    Guess they couldn’t handle that hold-hands-and-coordinate thing.


                                                                       8/9/2012

    You know how there are different weight classes in wrestling?

    I think other sports should do that too.

    For example, in the high jump, there should be a separate competitive class
    for short people.


                                                                       8/8/2012

    I don’t really understand weight lifting.

    People lift heavy stuff. 

    They don’t take it anywhere.

    They don’t do anything with it.

    They just pick it up — and then put it back down.


                                                                       8/7/2012

    Know why it took a hundred years for there to be a women’s triple jump?

    Because hopscotch isn’t really a challenge for us anymore.

    Know what event I’d like to see?

    Men’s double-dutch.


                                                                       8/7/2012

    And she can do it with a tennis ball in her mouth.


                                                                       8/6/2012

    So Usain Bolt won the hundred in 9.63 seconds.

    My dog can do better than that.

    And she’s only six years old.

    ‘Course, she’s black too.


                                                                       8/5/2012

    I heard one athlete emphasize the need to stay focused and keep his
    objective in mind.

    How hard can that be for a sprinter?


                                                                       8/4/2012

    How many swimmers does it take to change a light bulb?

    Don’t know yet. They keep getting electrocuted.


                                                                       8/3/2012

    Olympic athletes are especially driven.

    Imagine spending years trying to throw a really heavy ball a few
    centimetres further than the next guy.

    Now there’s a candidate for the Lifetime Achievement Award.


                                                                       8/2/2012

    Most athletes are driven by the desire to win.

    Not to win anything in particular, anything of significance, just – to win.


                                                                      7/29/2012

    We pray to this god.

    But he’s omniscient – he already knows what we’re going to say.

    And it’s not like we’re going to change his mind: hey, Supreme Being and
    Ruler of the Universe – this is what I think should happen here.


                                                                      7/25/2012

    Some people believe that when we die, we’re reincarnated.

    But if that were true, the human population shouldn’t be increasing.

    Unless there’s been a lot of pigs and cows who’ve been promoted – actually,
    I think I know some of them.


                                                                      7/21/2012

    A recent poll found that almost 80% of North Americans are Christian.

    They say they were born that way.


                                                                      7/18/2012

    President Bush kept talking about his “personal relationship with Jesus.”

    Which is odd, because the last time I talked to Jesus, he said he didn’t
    know him.


                                                                      7/14/2012

    I don’t think they should give driver’s licences to people who believe in
    life after death.


                                                                       7/9/2012

    People give $80 million a day to God. $80 million! A day!

    Just what the fuck has he been doing with all that money?

    And when do you think he’ll start paying taxes for roads, schools,
    hospitals, and stuff?


                                                                       7/3/2012

    The state motto of Ohio is “With God, all things are possible.”

    Oh yeah? Is it possible for him to create a rock so heavy he can’t lift it?


                                                                      6/29/2012

    They say God works in mysterious ways.

    Why is that again?


                                                                      6/27/2012

    And about this so-called ‘intelligent design’.

    Tornadoes don’t have guidance systems, we don’t have earlids, and pain
    hurts.


                                                                      6/23/2012

    Ever wonder why God doesn’t just once and for all provide conclusive
    evidence that he exists? Something simple and yet – godly.

    Nothing like throwing chunks of bread at us.


                                                                      6/20/2012

    What if there is a God – and heaven is only for those bright enough to
    recognize there’s no proof that he exists?


                                                                      6/16/2012

    Or maybe he exists, but he went on holiday and got lost because, like one
    of his favourite sons who took the forty-year desert tour, he doesn’t know
    how to stop and ask for directions.

    (Thanks to Julian Barnes.)


                                                                      6/15/2012

    Or maybe he does exist, but he’s abandoned us. We may have been a
    disappointment. Or an infectious disease.

    Maybe he inherited us. Or got us for Christmas. And he’s still trying to
    exchange us.


                                                                      6/14/2012

    Most people figure either God exists or he doesn’t. There are other
    possibilities.

    Maybe he used to exist, but he doesn’t anymore. Maybe he got run over by a
    truck.


                                                                       6/5/2012

    The men in Sweden don’t wear ties.

    I don’t know about you, but any country in which the men don’t walk around
    wearing little nooses gets my vote.

    Then again, given that most countries are nowhere near Sweden with regard
    to women in government (43%), the noose thing does provide a certain –
    convenience.


                                                                      5/29/2012

    When I was at a seaside restaurant, a waiter took three dead fish on a
    plate to some people at one of his tables – I guess so they could choose
    which one they wanted.

    At first I thought “Ugh!” But then I thought, well, people choose which
    lobster they want from a bunch swimming around in a tank.

    So okay, let’s at least be consistent then. Next time someone orders weiner
    schnitzel, let’s bring out all the little baby calves to frolic around the
    table.

    ‘Course if they’re gonna be weiner schnitzel, they’ve been kept too weak to
    frolic…


                                                                      5/24/2012

    You know how some men used to jingle coins in their pocket? “Look at me!
    I’m rich! I have a bunch of nickels and dimes in my pocket!”

    And then it became cool to carry around a lot of jangling keys. “Look at
    me! I’m important! I can open lots of doors!”

    Now, men – at least Greek men who’ve seen Lethal Weapon III – click two
    tied-together marbles. Over and over. Click-click. Click-click. “Look at
    me! I’m dangerous! I can strangle you!”

    I don’t know if they’re supposed to be worry beads or prayer beads or – I
    just call them balls-on-a-string. Teeny little itsy bitsy
    balls-on-a-string.


                                                                      5/17/2012

    In Italy, the street people don’t ask you for money exactly – they pray for
    it. Literally. They kneel on the sidewalk with their little cup in front of
    them and pray. Hands pressed together, eyes closed, the whole bit.

    So when you give them money, you’re validating their belief in – no, wait a
    minute, that was me who put the dollar in your cup, not God! Thanks be to
    me! I’m God!


                                                                      5/13/2012

    What is this obsession with taking pictures of everything?

    If you want pictures of these places, why not just buy the book?

    I swear some people took pictures of the postcards.

    ‘Course why not – the postcards always looked better than the real thing.


                                                                       5/7/2012

    As a species, we are so in love with ourselves, aren’t we? Almost every
    painting and certainly every sculpture I saw featured human subjects.

    I saw a few horses, a rabbit or two, and an antelope. But they were usually
    dead.

    Or dying a very horrible death.

    ‘Course it could just be that animals won’t sit still long enough.

    That could also explain why they were usually dead.


                                                                       5/1/2012

    I don’t think I was in the right mood for the Louvre. I saw this one really
    famous painting of a shipwreck, the main figure is on the beach,
    dramatically draped over crates and sails, in a pose of utter exhaustion.

    And all I thought was “Oh get a grip!”


                                                                      4/25/2012

    I got lost a lot. Even before I got to Amsterdam, I mean.

    I got lost getting from the train stations to the hotels. I got lost
    getting from the hotels to the museums. Then I started getting lost in the
    museums.

    It’s true. You can spend days in the Louvre.


                                                                      4/17/2012

    I noticed there were no garbage cans along the Champs D’Elysees – anywhere.

    And I thought “That’s wishful thinking.” It’s nonstop tourists.

    A block later I realized they’d just said “The hell with it,” given a woman
    a go-cart, put a vacuum cleaner on it, and made it a full-time job.


                                                                      4/10/2012

    Copenhagen is made for pedestrians.  It has lots of pedestrian-only spaces,
    the streets have these really wide sidewalks, and in Copenhagen,
    pedestrians always have the right of way.  You can be crossing the street
    anywhere and the cars will stop for you.

    They’ll do that in Amsterdam too.  Though that could be because you’re apt
    to be crossing the street backwards.  And giggling.

    But in Paris, cars always have the right of way.  Even if the little green
    man says it’s okay to cross.  Actually, in Paris, the little green man says
    “Okay – you can try – but –”

    Florence is rather like Paris in its attitude toward pedestrians, because
    in Italy there are no sidewalks at all.  Well, there are – but apparently
    they’re for cars.


                                                                       4/2/2012

    Europe doesn’t have the junk food we do. I had a heck of a time finding
    Doritos.

    Especially in, of all places, Amsterdam.


                                                                      3/25/2012

    One of the shops on the Champs D’Elysees is a travel agency for Iran Air –
    “The Airline of the Islamic Republic of Iran”.

    I’ll bet they’re not doing much business these days.

    Given the tendency of Islamic pilots to fly into buildings.


                                                                      3/22/2012

    Remember Jules Verne? The guy who went around the world in 80 days?

    He didn’t have to deal with airports and train stations and ferries.


                                                                      3/14/2012

    People in business class and first class need to feel important and
    special.

    So they get to board planes ahead of the rest of us.

    Along with the other infants and small children.


                                                                       3/9/2012

    Half the world’s population is under twenty-five. The ones who aren’t
    undernourished are crack babies or fetal alcohol syndrome babies or AIDS
    babies or babies who for no good reason reached adolescence and graduated
    from high school but can’t spell ‘graduated’.

    Makes you want to go right out and buy one of those ‘Children are Our
    Future’ posters.


                                                                       3/1/2012

    A site chosen for a nuclear power plant is two miles from an active fault
    line, and the blueprints for the reactors got mixed up, so the earthquake
    fault supports were installed backwards.

    Oh yeah-–we’re definitely ready for that anti-matter stuff.


                                                                      2/19/2012

    If you’re so proud to be American, why do you wear a Canadian flag when you
    travel?


                                                                      2/11/2012

    Many men express surprise and puzzlement upon hearing the words “I’m
    pregnant.”

    Apparently many of us still haven’t connected having sex with having
    babies.


                                                                       2/5/2012

    There have been over 1900 tests of nuclear weapons since World War II.
    You’d think we’d get it right after, say, the first couple hundred.

    And we haven’t figured out yet what to do with the leftover stuff. We have
    enough radioactive waste to contaminate all of the Earth’s lakes and rivers
    – twice. Canada alone has enough to stack a six foot high pile along the
    TransCanada Highway from coast to coast. We don’t know what to do with the
    stuff. But we keep making it.

    We tossed some of it into the ocean. But apparently it doesn’t just
    dissolve. We launched some of it into outer space. But now the insurance
    companies won’t cover our space shuttles for collision. We buried some of
    it in containers–that clearly won’t last as long as the stuff itself. And
    we used some of it to build schools and kitchen tables. Call it recycling.
    Our favourite way to get rid of it, however, seems to be sneaking into some
    other country’s back yard late at night, dumping it, and then running away.


                                                                      1/26/2012

    We do heroic things to save whales caught in the ice with insufficient
    oxygen.

    Otherwise, they would never get the chance to experience a long, slow death
    from PCB poisoning.


                                                                      1/18/2012

    I used to run a support group for people in denial.

    But no one ever came.


                                                                      1/12/2012

    The team of genetic researchers that successfully cloned a sheep from a
    single adult cell named the sheep “Dolly”, after a certain large-breasted
    country singer, because the cell had come from a mammary gland.

    Grown men, brilliant men, men on the cutting edge of science, men who
    become headline news, are quite likely still forcing farts at the dinner
    table and snickering about it.


                                                                       1/5/2012

    In the spring of 1991, Fred Turner set out from Beaufort, South Carolina,
    to walk across America in order to prove that most people are good.

    He got as far as the state line before he was robbed and pushed off a
    bridge.


                                                                     12/31/2011

    Another reason we’re too stupid to visit…

    We make toy guns, encouraging our kids to play at killing each other.


                                                                     12/24/2011

    I don’t do Christmas.

    As Zoe Fairburns points out, “The birth of a male who thinks he’s god isn’t
    such a rare event.”


                                                                     12/15/2011

    The Training Center for Subversive Warfare teaches that “Torture must be
    kept clean, it must not be carried out in the presence of those with
    sadistic tendencies, it must be carried out by some responsible person, and
    above all, it must be humane.”

    Otherwise, it would be, what, wrong?


                                                                      12/7/2011

    The economic system used for decision-making by the United Nations, the
    World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and national governments
    considers only cash-generating activities to be productive.

    So Tendai, who lives in Zimbabwe and spends eighteen hours a day providing
    food, clothing, and shelter for herself and her children, is unproductive.

    But Bubba, who sits on a nuclear missile for eight hours a day waiting for
    an order to push a button and destroy the planet – he’s productive.


                                                                     11/27/2011

    Lieutenant General Daniel Graham once said ‘If a one megaton bomb was about
    to explode over this building and you had the good sense to start walking
    and get behind a lilac bush, that bomb would not hurt you.’ 


    He was later chosen to be the Senior Military Advisor to the President.


                                                                     11/21/2011

    Women, as a matter of routine, redden their lips, ornament their ears, push
    up their breasts, display their legs, and arch their feet.

    Then they get pissed off if you see them as sex objects.

    And they get really pissed off if you then tell they’re being irrational.


                                                                     11/14/2011

    North Americans spend five billion dollars each year on special diets.

    When it would be far cheaper to just move to Africa.


                                                                      11/2/2011

    When AIDS became an epidemic, a certain company recalled the condoms not up
    to their new standards, claiming ‘a certain social responsibility’.

    Apparently they were unaware that people had been using their condoms not
    only to prevent the transmission of disease, but also to prevent the
    transmission of sperm.


                                                                     10/28/2011

    Being male is very much about being in control.

    One has to wonder, therefore, why they hang their entire ‘manhood’ on some
    one thing over which they biologically have no voluntary control
    whatsoever.
    (And they say they’re the logical ones.)


                                                                     10/19/2011

    In Saudi Arabia, a woman must be accompanied by a man whenever she appears
    in public; otherwise, she is subject to torture.

    Otherwise?


                                                                     10/14/2011

    In our species, sexual desire seems to induce a state of temporary idiocy.
    Which is why it is not particularly encouraging that the male half of the
    species actually brags about being in a constant state of sexual readiness.


                                                                      10/7/2011

    The U.S. continues to puzzle over the persistence of racism.

    It also continues to call the official residence of the President “The
    White House.”


                                                                      10/5/2011

    Some of our best and brightest philosophers have spent years trying to
    convince us that time doesn’t exist.


                                                                      10/1/2011

    A sign on a community bulletin board saying “Learn to read English–Classes
    held Monday nights!” was posted by the Board of Education.


                                                                      9/26/2011

    The Annual Turing Test Competition is an event in which a panel of experts
    asks questions from a remote location of a bunch of computers and a bunch
    of people. If they can’t tell that a computer is a computer, it passes the
    Turing Test – it is deemed able to think.

    In a recent competition, some of the people failed the test.


                                                                      9/22/2011

    A worker, no doubt somebody’s kid, accidentally dropped a socket wrench
    down a silo – it hit a missile causing an explosion that launched a nine
    megaton hydrogen bomb into a field several hundred yards away. Oops.

    Because of naval mishaps, there are now nine nuclear reactors and fifty
    nuclear warheads on the ocean floor. Mishaps.

    A nuclear bomb fell out of a U.S. bomber and landed in a Carolina swamp. It
    has not yet been found. Perhaps the localized proliferation of two-headed
    alligators should be considered a clue.

    The U.S. dropped four plutonium bombs on Spain by mistake. I have to ask:
    four at once or on four separate occasions?


                                                                      9/18/2011

    Many of us are too unimaginative–or too lazy–or both–to make our lives
    worthwhile.  So we have kids.  That’s our contribution to society.  Genetic
    replications of our deficiency.

    This inability to find fulfillment in the here and now is shared by those
    who set their sights instead on some heaven.  No surprise, they’re the ones
    with the most kids.


                                                                      9/16/2011

    In a recent experiment involving monkeys, 13% pulled a chain
    electroshocking an unrelated monkey whose agony was in plain view.  In a
    similar experiment conducted with humans, 65% administered the shock, to
    the point of fatality.

    Much to do was subsequently made about the ethics – of the experimenters.


                                                                      9/12/2011

    We came up with the concept of ‘garbage’: stuff we don’t want here – so we
    put it there. All gone!


                                                                      9/10/2011

    McMaster University initiated a research project to study the health
    effects of war.

    Perhaps some genius hypothesized that it causes death.


                                                                       9/6/2011

    Two bombs in a building were set to go off an hour apart, and the Mayor of
    the City said, “The second bomb was clearly designed to hurt the rescue
    workers coming to assist, so we’re dealing with a warped mind here.”

    Um, wouldn’t the first bomb kind of establish that?


                                                                      8/31/2011

    It costs more than $115,000 to create a job in crude oil production. It
    costs only $20,000 to create a job in solar energy production. We have an
    unemployment problem. We have an energy problem.

    And we have a math problem.


                                                                      8/25/2011

    Over half of our planet’s scientists and engineers work for the military.

    The other half work for Pizza Pizza.


                                                                      8/21/2011

    Men pride themselves on being objective, they champion the impersonal.

    And yet they’ll do anything to win. To be, personally, number one.


                                                                      8/20/2011

    Most men generally don’t think much of most women.

    And yet, they continue to prohibit them from joining the military, where
    they could easily get killed.


                                                                      8/14/2011

    We distinguish males from females. Before we do anything else. And before
    we do everything else. For example, ‘Mr. Smith’ really means ‘Penis-Person
    Smith’. The use of such sex-identifying prefixes is considered polite.

    The use of ‘Penis-Person’ – or ‘Dickhead’ – is not. Apparently.


                                                                       8/9/2011

    We’re still trying to get our whites whiter.


                                                                       8/4/2011

    We sentenced Socrates to death and let a number of serial killers live.


                                                                       8/1/2011

    We put tons of carcinogens into our food, water, and air.

    And then spend millions of dollars looking for the cure for cancer.

    Oh where oh where could it be.


                                                                      7/27/2011

    If the history of the Earth were a year, life would not appear until March,
    multi-cellular organisms not until November. Dinosaurs would show up on
    December 13, and mammals on December 15. On December 31, we’d show up. By
    late evening, we’d have well-developed brains.

    And then it’d take us 60 seconds to thoroughly trash the place.


                                                                      7/23/2011

    Most of us still think there’s a god.

    Well, okay, maybe that’s not really a problem.

    We still think it’s an all-wise and all-good god.


                                                                      7/20/2011

    Are there intelligent life forms out there in the universe?

    Well yeah. No one’s visited us yet.


                                                                      7/16/2011

    Have you noticed that more and more athletes are saying a quick prayer at
    the starting line?

    A clear admission that you can’t possibly win without divine intervention,
    yeah, that’ll really psych out your opponents.


                                                                       7/4/2011

    A contraceptive pill designed for men was rejected because of the negative
    side-effect of reducing their sex drive.

    Given the reason for taking the pill, wouldn’t that have been a positive
    side-effect?
