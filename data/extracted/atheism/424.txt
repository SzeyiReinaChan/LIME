Open to all ethical atheists, agnostics, skeptics and other freethinkers, the
Delaware Association for Humanism exists for the betterment of humanity and for
the planet we all share. DAH is an affiliate of the Council for Secular
Humanism and is a charter chapter of the American Humanist Association. As
such, we adhere to the humanist philosophy these organizations embody. In
addition to getting together to socialize and discuss beliefs, philosophies and
the challenges of being 'outsiders', we aim to become a real presence in the
Delaware community. By improving our visibility, we can work to thwart
church-state violations on the local level and add our voices to the efforts of
groups working on the national level. If you share the desire to see reason
replace faith; if you champion the efforts of rational thought and human
compassion in improving our Delaware communities, then we hope you will join
us!
