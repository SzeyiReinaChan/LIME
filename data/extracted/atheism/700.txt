Electing Secular Leaders, Defending Secular America

Freethought Equality Fund

The mission of the Freethought Equality Fund (FEF) PAC is to change the face of
American politics and to achieve equality by increasing the number of open
humanists and atheists in public office at all levels of government. The FEF
PAC is affiliated with the Center for Humanist Activism, which is the advocacy
and political arm of the American Humanist Association.

The FEF PAC will provide nontheist Americans the opportunity to make their
voices heard in the political process by supporting candidates who identify as
humanist, atheist, agnostic, and who share our goals of protecting the
separation of church and state and defending the civil liberties of secular
Americans.

When people see respected ethical humanists and atheists serve in public
office, this will begin to dispel many myths about nonbelievers. The FEF PAC
will also support a number of candidates who identify as religious but who are
leaders in supporting the rights of nonbelievers.
