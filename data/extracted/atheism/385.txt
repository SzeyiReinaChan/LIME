The purpose of Freethought Arizona is to establish, grow, and support a
community of secular humanists, freethinkers, skeptics, agnostics, and atheists
that is based on reason, science, and critical thinking. Our goals are to
maintain separation of church and state, advance education and science, examine
and discuss literature, support families, work to eliminate prejudice and
discrimination, and protect the civil rights of our members and others through
meetings, lectures, debates, discussions, protests, letters to the editor,
blogs, podcasts, broadcast appearances and any other reasonable and civil means
available.

The Freethought Arizona Meetup.com website exists for the benefit of the
members of Freethought Arizona and others who are interested in the mission and
activities of the organization. Announcements of meetings and events sponsored
by other organizations may also be included in our calendar but each will be
identified as such.

It may be necessary to moderate the discussions posted on the site on occasion.

Comments may be removed by the website moderators for any of the following
reasons:

1. The comments fall outside the intended scope of the Freethought Arizona
Meetup.com website.  For example, messages that attempt to sell products or
services (SPAM) not applicable to the organization and its mission.

2. Threats of violence.

3.  Obscene, vulgar, or lewd material.

4. Defamatory, fraudulent statements or abusive ad hominem comments.

5.  Terms commonly understood to constitute profanity or abusive or degrading
slurs or epithets.

6. Information that invades an individual’s privacy.

7. Information that if published would violate criminal law or give rise to
civil liability.

Freethought Arizona encourages the free exchange of ideas. We can and should
challenge the ideas of others while maintaining respect for each other.

Questions and comments can be directed to the organizer:
webguy@freethought-az.org or you may also go to the Message Board and ask
questions or offer opinions.
