Still Gone

I've noticed some people are still subscribing to my RSS feeds, which is a
little confusing to me. You can take me off, this blog is truly dead. -_^ I've
come back to delete all my old posts for various reasons and just make sure
people are aware that if they want to follow my writing, I'm over at
examiner.com now as the Boston Atheism Examiner. Come check it out. :D

Moving On

I have decided to close down this blog because I have come to accept Jesus
Christ as my personal savior.

Or I'm moving on to bigger better things.

Thankfully it's the latter.

I applied to the Examiner.com for a position as the Boston Atheism Examiner and
was accepted. This is an opportunity to really focus on my writing skills and
represent atheism in a more media based way. I can earn money from this and
reach out to a bigger audience. As a result it will require more of my time
making it very difficult to keep updating this blog in a meaningful way, which
is why I will no longer be updating this blog.

For those who have subscribed to this blog I would be honored if you continued
following me over on examiner.com. However, if you prefer a more informal
outlet, I am and will continue to contribute to the Boston Atheists Blog and
the Boston Atheists Podcast.

And also I want thank everyone who have been following this short lived blog, I
have really appreciated it. :D
