The Dallas Atheist Book Club is a place for freethinkers (atheists, agnostics,
skeptics, secularists, etc.) to read and to engage in lively discussion about
books relating to atheism, freethought, science, history, governance,
biography, psychology, philosophy, and some fiction.

We try to meet on the second Wednesday of each month at 7:00 PM for the book
review. This is usually followed up with a social gathering at a local
restaurant or bar for dinner and drinks at 9:00 PM.

We also occasionally meet for a movie night and informal get together from time
to time as well.

Please check the group's calendar for an update list of events. The "Pages" tab
on the group's Meetup site also has lots if information as well as a list of
past, present and future books.
