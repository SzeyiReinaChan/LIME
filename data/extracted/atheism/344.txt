    When In Doubt

    So, you find yourself questioning the existence of your god. No matter your
    religion, that’s pretty frightening. All these years, raised to believe
    that an all-knowing, all-loving being was out there, somewhere, and that he
    had a plan for you. That your parents and community knew the ‘Truth.’ Most
    importantly, you’ve been instructed that when [...]

    Volunteering Visibly is Vital

    During a recent volunteer meeting for a local humanists group, we examined
    the importance of doing visible volunteerism. Donald Wright, initiator of
    the Day of Solidarity for Black Non-Believers and author of The Only Prayer
    I’ll Ever Pray, headed the meeting and read a fitting portion from the
    Humanist Manifesto III: Working to benefit society maximizes [...]

    Deceptive Language

    To introduce this blog piece, I must first share with you something
    important about words and titles, and how I choose to use them. You see, I
    am not a member of the organization known as the Roman Catholic Church
    (RCC). It is an organization that seeks to dominate and self-promote, using
    fear tactics and [...]

    Pharmacists In Kansas Can Now Deny Women Access To Birth Control Kansas
    Gov. Sam Brownback (R) signed a bill that will allow pharmacists in the
    state to refuse to fill a prescription they think could be used to induce
    abortion. … the law’s opponents say it could allow a pharmacist to
    interfere with a woman’s [...]

    #NudePhotoRevolutionary

    In a press release today, Maryam Namazie formally announced the #
    nudephotorevolutionary calendar.  As Aliaa Magda Elmahdy chose to stand up
    against female oppression, we too advocate for free-expression and women’s
    rights.  This calendar features black and white nude photographs, and I’m
    Ms. September.  For Maryam’s article announcing the calendar’s release and
    to purchase a calendar [...]

    Abundant Bliss

    The persistent stereotype pushed by Christians about atheists is that we
    are all unhappy, unpleasant, miserable people.  This claim is used to
    derail conversations and defame and disarm atheists and atheism as a
    whole.  What’s most disheartening is that the often genuinely kind and
    loving individuals that are unwittingly abrasive making these claims… are
    persistent [...]

Where God Wasn’t

Where God Wasn’t

HypoChristi | Wed 8 May 2013 | 0 Comments | 103 Views

This post is the most difficult piece I have ever written. Since I started
blogging, I’ve been itching to tell what pushed me in the direction of
realizing there was no god looking over me. I have refrained from this topic
because it will expose my darkest, most painful memories that still haunt me to

Punished for Choosing to Live

Punished for Choosing to Live

Emily Dietle | Fri 3 May 2013 | 15 Comments | 17211 Views

The following is a guest post from Steph Le Gardener. Steph is on Facebook, and
has a YouTube channel you should check out. Twenty-two years ago a registered
letter changed the course of my life. The letter stated that I had been judged
guilty of “conduct unbecoming a Christian” and had been disfellowshipped from
the [...]

If Prayer Worked

If Prayer Worked

Emily Dietle | Thu 2 May 2013 | 1 Comment | 1066 Views

Today is the National Day of Prayer. If there were a great being somewhere out
there, where scientists haven’t yet explored, and if in some unfathomable way
this creature could reach through time and space to both hear and fulfill our
voiced concerns, there are a few things I would request of this god-like being.

Church in Houston, TX for a special event that seeks to improve relations
between non-believers and the faithful by increasing their understanding of our
god(s)-free outlook. The evening will be hosted by Ken Chitwood, who writes for
the belief section of the [...]

Mocking the Christ

Mocking the Christ

Emily Dietle | Wed 24 Apr 2013 | 7 Comments | 442 Views

On occasion, a religious person will post to my public Facebook account,
unannounced and unsolicited. I wish that the interface would not allow guest
posts to be deleted after publishing- which is what one Ronald Eck did today.
Minutes after cordially accepting his friend request, Ronald posted, “In God I
trust and only in God…and [...]

Irreligious Environmentalism

Irreligious Environmentalism

Emily Dietle | Wed 24 Apr 2013 | 3 Comments | 1703 Views

What does Earth Day mean to an atheist? What significance does environmentalism
have on humanists? These are time-worthy examinations for non-believers, and
are also important questions for people of faith who scrutinize the motives and
morality of the godless. As atheists, we conclude that there is most likely no
supernatural being to lift us out [...]

Rectifying Ritual

Rectifying Ritual

Emily Dietle | Tue 23 Apr 2013 | 3 Comments | 245 Views

Reiki, Kundalini yoga, prayer, sacred drumming, the laying of hands. Many well
intentioned people are swept into the fantasy that there is something mystical
or supernatural in their practice. Reiki, for example, claims that an unseen
“life force energy” flows through each us, giving life, and that if that
“energy” is low, it affects our [...]

Just Plain Pretty

HypoChristi | Sun 14 Apr 2013 | 1 Comment | 379 Views

Thanks to a busy school schedule these past three months, I’ve not had time to
post anything. It’s been a crazy time of ups and downs, but I’m back while I
have the chance. Anyhow, I’d like to discuss a frequent concern that everyone
deals with: body image. Looking around each day, I catch myself [...]

A Priest, a Rabbi, and a Minister Walk Into an Immigration Office

As I was reading about forty-seven year old “Reverend” Angel Armando Perez,
sentenced Monday for the sexual assault of a twelve year old boy, one note
about him stood out boldly. The first priest of Mexican descent in Portland OR,
is in this country legally because he is a minister of religion. During the
past [...]

The fiftieth anniversary of American Atheists is happening right now. Dave
Silverman has taken the stage. His opening remarks highlight the statistical
success and rise of atheism, and the importance of “FireBrand atheism,” which
he describes in the following five rules. 1. Tell the truth. Religion is a lie.
All gods are false. Respect is [...]
