Mission Statement
The mission of R.E.A.S.O.N. (Rationalists, Empiricists and Skeptics of
Nebraska) is to encourage critical thinking. Members are dedicated to
researching and exposing fallacies in such areas as medical quackery,
pseudoscience, Biblical literalism, religious and political extremism, racism,
and homophobia. We promote the use of scientific methods, evidence, logic, and
reason to gain insight and understanding.
