                        Stephen Eric Bronner
                        presents his topic

                        By Patti Butcheck, on
                        December 13th, 2015

                        It is our pleasure and
                        honor to host Stephen Eric
                        Bronner on Wednesday, 
                        January 13, 2016 as he
                        presents his interesting
                        topic, “The New Bigot.”  

                        Stephen Eric Bronner

                        Stephen Eric Bronner

                         

                        Bronner will address the
                        way in which there is a
                        new and more important
                        form of bigotry targeting
                        groups that have always
                        been victims, but with a
                        different type of
                        language. Unless the
                        tactics of the new bigot
                        are understood, it becomes
                        even more difficult to
                        oppose this type of
                        prejudice.

                        The presentation will take
                        place at the Ludington
                        Library, 5 South Bryn Mawr
                        Avenue, Bryn Mawr, 
                        Pennsylvania 19010 at 7:00
                        PM.

                        Want to help? Please visit
                        our Helping Hands page to
                        learn more about how the
                        Freethought Society
                        continues to give back to
                        our community, and how you
                        can make a difference!

                        Sole Searching

                        The Freethought Society
                        (FS) is pleased to
                        continue another project
                        to benefit the homeless
                        community. Donate your
                        gently worn shoes at an FS
                        event or at a
                        monthly meeting. All
                        donations will be
                        acknowledged with a “thank
                        you” and receipt that can
                        be used for tax deduction
                        purposes.

                        Large boxes filled with
                        shoes will be delivered to
                        a homeless shelter
                        in Pennsylvania. Please
                        note that shoes with high
                        heels are not appropriate
                        for donation.

                        The more sturdy the shoe,
                        the better! Boots, work
                        and sport shoes are best.
                        Please do not donate
                        over-used and/or dirty
                        shoes.

                        Thanks in advance for
                        looking through your
                        closet and locating shoes
                        that you no longer enjoy
                        wearing. Consider yourself
                        sole-searching. There is
                        no such thing as an
                        out-of-style shoe in the
                        homeless community. All
                        flat-style shoes can be of
                        use and will be greatly
                        appreciated.

                        Please “step up” to
                        participate and imagine
                        what it is like to “walk
                        in the shoes” of
                        a homeless person.

                        The Freethought Society
                        (FS) is proud to continue
                        the “Jeans Only Clothing
                        Drive.” Donate your gently
                        worn jeans at an FS event
                        or monthly meeting. Jeans
                        are too heavy to ship, so
                        an inperson donation is
                        necessary. All donors will
                        receive a receipt for tax
                        purposes. When FS fills a
                        large box with donated
                        jeans, the box will be
                        delivered to a homeless
                        shelter in Pennsylvania.
                        This type of “Jean
                        Therapy” can benefit many
                        people who are in need of
                        sturdy clothing. FS seeks
                        all sizes, including jeans
                        for children, young adults
                        and seniors. Please do not
                        donate stained, ripped or
                        torn jeans. Ask your
                        family, friends and
                        neighbors to donate to
                        this effort.

                        participate in this
                        collection. Let’s find
                        merchants who are willing
                        to help. Please contact FS
                        to request a poster that
                        can be used to gather
