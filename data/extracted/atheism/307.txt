Pausing our weekly programmes

April 15, 2014Admin bits and piecesadmin

Hi gang,

After nearly five years, we’ve decided to take a break from our weekly
programmes here at The Pod Delusion.

The reason for this change is fairly predictable: The two of us (James and Liz)
are simply too busy – and are struggling to fit producing an hour of audio
every week into a schedule where we also have other voluntary commitments, let
alone a need to earn a living! So rather than let the show suffer as a result,
we’ve decided the best thing to do is to take a brief pause.

To reflect for a brief moment, it has been an incredible half decade. The show
has grown to have many thousands of listeners every week, we’ve seen so many
incredible contributions to the show and our guest-list is a who’s-who of
interesting figures from politics, science, technology, comedy. Speaking
personally, it has been amazing both for professional reasons, and also because
I can tick-off having met the vast majority of my personal heroes (I mentioned
we interviewed Chris Hadfield, right?).

It has been amazing, but like I say, exhausting.

We’d obviously like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who has
supported the show – there’s far too many contributors to name individually,
but without your contributions the show would be nothing. It has been a team
effort – and everyone has brought incredible things to the Pod Delusion table.
Similarly, we’d like to thank everyone who listens and all of the organisations
we’ve worked with for supporting the show (most notably the British Humanist
Association and Resonance FM).

Worry not though – this is very definitely not the end, and is more of a break
to catch our breath. We plan to keep making special programmes, but want the
flexibility not to have to produce a programme on a weekly basis. One such
future special will be on the World Humanist Congress in August – and we hope
to have released at least a couple more in addition before then. Our intention
currently is also to go back to weekly programmes later in the year (maybe even
in a couple of months, work-load depending). We’re also working on one or two
other secret things that should be fun, should they see the light of day.

In the meantime, you can find me (James) on Twitter, YouTube, and my personal
website. By day, I am a freelance writer and broadcaster, so I’d love to hear
from you if you’d like me to write or produce audio/video content for you – I
specialise in consumer technology though can also talk more broadly about
technology, politics, international relations, skepticism and media.

Similarly, you can find Liz on Twitter or on her blog – or inevitably
co-starring in all of the stuff that I do.

We’re also both trustees of the excellent Conway Hall in London – so do check
that out if you like similar stuff to what is on The Pod Delusion. Better
still, join up as a member!

You can also still follow The Pod Delusion on Twitter for updates on when we do
make new stuff – or of course subscribe to our RSS feed.

Thanks again for all of the support over the last few years – we’ll be back!

Cheers,

James and Liz
