This episode Derek has a conversation with Zack Wienersmith, the creator/author
of the popular web comic series 'Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal' (SMBC).
Zach was a speaker at The Amazing Meeting 13, so while they were both in the
same building Derek was able to get some time with Zack to discuss how he got
interested in science, skeptical thinking, and how the two relate... or not.
