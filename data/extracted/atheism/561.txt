Welcome

boardRandallKallenanWelcome to the Humanists of Houston (HOH) website!

Our organization has been the premier Humanist group in Houston since 1978. HOH
exists to provide the opportunity for like-minded Humanists, atheists,
agnostics, skeptics, and freethinkers to fellowship, socialize, and enjoy
thought provoking activities on the interesting issues of our day.

sethAndrewsEventAs a Humanist group, we do not merely hold a naturalistic
worldview based on reason, but are also concerned with living ethical,
meaningful lives with concern for our fellow human being. As such, HOH also
participates in a variety of activities designed to advance Humanist causes and
values in the Houston area.

Please feel free to learn more about us and our events and activities by
browsing the site. The Humanists of Houston is a nonprofit 501(c)(3)
organization. If you are interested in attending, joining, or simply have
questions, please contact us!
