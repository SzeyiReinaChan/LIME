The Uncontested Word: Why do Some Historians Treat Religious Texts as Sacred?

Richard Firth-Godbehere contemplates the historical provenance and value of
religious texts.

There are a great many historians who practice religions of all flavours. Some
historians jump headlong into the history of their particular faith, blending
it with apologetics and philosophy. Others simply ignore their religious
predilections and concentrate on other areas of history, sealing their faith in
a mental box with a sign huge on the lid reading ‘do not enter while studying’.
I am sure this arrangement or something similar to it is found throughout all
walks of academic life, but I find it particularly puzzling when I find it
amongst historians. I know of many good historians who take their collection of
fables as absolutely true; it is one of the most fascinating and puzzling
examples of cognitive dissonance I know of.

After all, a historian is, by definition, someone who is deeply sceptical about
old texts and artefacts. It is a historian’s job to dust off manuscripts, wade
through archives, dig things out of dark corners and not believe a word of it
(unless there is some good supporting evidence, of course). Even when a
historian does believe a word of it, he tempers this with a deep analysis of
the text or object at hand, stripping it down in order to work out what the
narrative really is, as opposed to what the text or object claims it is. In
short, we historians are deeply sceptical pedants: each and every one of us. So
why does pedantry, suspicion and obsessive checking, cross-checking, double
checking and rechecking disappear so often in the face of a religious text?
Here, I’ll take a lightly meandering journey through the peripheries of the
philosophy of history in order to find out if there is any validity in
accepting a religious text as good source of history.
