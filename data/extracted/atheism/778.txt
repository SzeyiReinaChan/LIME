(BAAm) is a non-profit organization dedicated to bridging the gap between
atheism[ayanna] and the black community. Because religion is so deeply
ingrained in the black community, black atheists often find themselves as a
dual minority in the overall atheist community. BAAm hopes that its efforts
will build a stronger overall atheist community by encouraging black atheists
to be open about their stance on religion. Please help us achieve our mission
by donating.

I am happy to annouce our new page – It has been a rough road getting our
website together. We still have a lot of work to do, but we are happy that we
can now start our membership drive. I would like to thank everyone for their
support over the years and I look forward to seeing BAAm continue to grow! Best
Wishes, Ayanna
