Quackwatch is now an international network of people who are concerned about
health-related frauds, myths, fads, fallacies, and misconduct. Its primary
focus is on quackery-related information that is difficult or impossible to get
elsewhere. To help visitors with special areas of interest, Dr. Barrett
maintains 24 additional sites for autism, chiropractic, dentistry, multilevel
marketing, and many other hot topics. Our Internet Health Pilot site provides
links to hundreds of reliable health sites. Our Casewatch site contains a large
library of legal cases, licensing board actions, government sanctions, and
regulatory actions against questionable medical products. We are also
affiliated with Bioethics Watch, which highlights issues of questionable
research on humans. A;; of these can be accessed through the "Visit Our
Affiliated Sites" drop-down menu above. Their contents can be searched
selectively with our WebGlimpse multi-site search engine or all at once through
