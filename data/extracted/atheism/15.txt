With the First Church of Atheism you can become ordained quickly, easily, and
at no cost.

Since its inception, the First Church of Atheism has amassed quite a following
around the world. FCA ministers come from all walks of life. They are every
race, ethnicity, age, and creed. The one thing binding every FCA minister is
his or her belief in science, reason, and reality.

The First Church of Atheism wants you to pursue and cherish your realistic
beliefs without interference from any outside agency, including government or
church authority. We provide our service for free, as we believe it is every
atheists right to perform these clergy functions.

You may become a legally ordained minister for life, without cost, and without
question.
