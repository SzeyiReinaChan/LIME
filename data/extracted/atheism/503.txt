  • Join us!

The Omaha Metro Area Humanist Association (OMAHA) works to bring about a
progressive society where being good without a god is an accepted way to live
life. We accomplish this through our outreach to the growing number of people
without traditional religious faith, and through a continued refinement and
advancement of the humanist worldview.

Humanism encompasses a variety of nontheistic views (atheism, agnosticism,
rationalism, naturalism, secularism, and so forth) while adding the important
element of a comprehensive worldview and set of ethical values - values that
are grounded in the philosophy of the Enlightenment, informed by scientific
knowledge, and driven by a desire to meet the needs of people in the here and
now.

We count humanists and other nontheists as the core of our movement but are
always willing to work with friends and allies on issues of common concern. The
positions we hold and the actions we take are not simply for our own benefit,
but for the betterment of all of society and the world in which we live.
