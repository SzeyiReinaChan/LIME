Quote of the Week

Mustafa Kemal Ataturk
 My people are going to learn the principles of democracy the dictates of truth
and the teachings of science. Superstition must go. Let them worship as they
will, every man can follow his own conscience provided it does not interfere
with sane reason or bid him act against the liberty of his fellow men."

Welcome to the Secular Alliance

      Atheist. Agnostic. Humanist. Pastafarian. Bright. Freethinker. Secular.
                 Rationalist. Skeptic. Non-Religious. Questioning.

[salogo]Whatever label (or lack thereof) you chose to use, we welcome you into
the Secular Alliance at the University of Chicago. Maybe you're already an
agnostic or athiest, and want to find your fellow non-believers on campus.
Maybe you're questioning religion and want to hear a different side. Perhaps
you're looking for other critical thinkers. Maybe you're curious about exactly
what it means to be "secular", and want to see if you fit the definition.
Whatever your reason, we hope you'll find a community here.

What We Do

Founded three years ago, the University of Chicago Secular Alliance has grown
from a group of 8 students meeting once a week to watch YouTube videos and
discuss secular issues in the world, to a significant part of the spiritual
life community on campus. Some of the things we've done:

   Debates with Intervarsity Christian Fellowship and other religious groups
Co-hosting talks from PZ Myers, Greta Christina, Serah Blain, Ted Cox, and Sam
                                    Harris
                          Sell your Soul for a Cookie
                           Funny YouTube video days
                               Creationist Bingo
                               ...and much more!

We have a lot more planned for this year, and the future, so we hope you'll
join us!
