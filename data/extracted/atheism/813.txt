About the University of Melbourne Secular Society

Do you prefer evidence to faith? Value science over superstition? Feel that
decisions should be based on reason rather than dogma? If so, then the
University of Melbourne Secular Society is the club for you!

We offer a unique alternative to the many religious clubs on campus. In
addition to standard social activities of pub nights and movie screenings, we
also hold discussions, lectures, and forums on issues surrounding science,
religion, secularism, humanism, and skepticism.

If you would like to keep informed about upcoming events, please subscribe to
our mailing list and/or join our Facebook group. To join the club, show up to
any event. For information about past events, check out our event archive. For
other information, check out our FAQ or email us at unimelbsecular@gmail.com.

Club aims

 1. to encourage freedom from superstition, irrationalism, and dogma
 2. to further the acceptance and application of science, reason, and critical
    thinking on campus and in the wider community
 3. to stimulate debate surrounding ideas of religion, science, philosophy,
    politics and ethics
 4. to defend the separation of church and state, individual freedoms and civil
    liberties for all persons, regardless of race, sex, gender, class, creed,
    ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, and disability
 5. to create a united campus community for freethinkers, skeptics, atheists,
    agnostics and humanists in the pursuit of these common goals
