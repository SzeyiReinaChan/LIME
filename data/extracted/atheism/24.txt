Welcome!

The Secular Web is owned and operated by Internet Infidels Inc., a 501(c)(3)
nonprofit educational organization dedicated to promoting and defending a
naturalistic worldview on the Internet.

As defined by Paul Draper, naturalism is "the hypothesis that the natural world
is a closed system, which means that nothing that is not a part of the natural
world affects it." Thus, "naturalism implies that there are no supernatural
entities"—including God.
Gather around the Kiosk for thought-provoking articles, informal essays,
reviews, humor, satire, fiction, opinions, and fascinating memes.

Quotation of the Minute
"To the Jews I became as a Jew, to win the Jews; to those under the law I
became as one under the law-though not being myself under the law-that I might
win those under the law. To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak.
I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some. I do
it all for the sake of the gospel..." Paul, 1 Corinthians 9:20-23
