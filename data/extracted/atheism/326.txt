Circle

LifeRing Secular Recovery is an abstinence-based, worldwide network of
individuals seeking to live in recovery from addiction to alcohol or to other
non-medically indicated drugs. In LifeRing, we offer each other peer-to-peer
support in ways that encourage personal growth and continued learning through
personal empowerment. Our approach is based on developing, refining, and
sharing our own personal strategies for continued abstinence and crafting a
rewarding life in recovery. In short, we are sober, secular, and self-directed.

LifeRing Bookstore

[3-Book-Spread-3]

If you’re looking to get clean and sober or just thinking about it, reading is
a good way to learn about recovery. You can start with two books from LifeRing
Press: Empowering Your Sober Self – a general introduction to LifeRing, and 
Recovery by Choice, a Workbook – a guide to help you build an abstinence-based
Personal Recovery Program. For those people who want a better understanding of
how a LifeRing meeting works you can read How Was Your Week. All three of these
books are available at the LifeRing bookstore.

Start a LifeRing meeting

Looking for a way to help yourself and your community? Start a face-to-face
LifeRing meeting. We are always looking for motivated people to start new
LifeRing meetings. If you are interested, you need to have six months of
sobriety and a desire for a challenge in life. Starting a new meeting is not
easy, but it can be a rewarding experience, both for yourself and others. For
more information, please contact the LifeRing Service Center at
service@lifering.org. Click here for more information.

general and LifeRing in particular, we have two services available for your
