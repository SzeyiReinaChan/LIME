Religion, Superstition and Pseudoscience:             ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓

The amazing thing about religion is the gullibility   ┃  on this page...  ┃
that it demands. The religious person must believe    ┃ Christian         ┃
things that he reads, or that he is told, without     ┃ intolerance       ┃
giving any consideration to whether those things      ┃ Voluntary         ┃
are true or not. How would the remainder of our       ┃ euthanasia        ┃
lives go if we applied the same rule?                 ┃ Religion is a     ┃
                                                      ┃ superstition      ┃
If you belong to one of the faiths 'of the Book' –    ┃ Reward and        ┃
Judaism, Christianity and Islam – you would believe   ┃ punishment in     ┃
that God spoke to various prophets in times past,     ┃ religion          ┃
and that those prophets recorded God's words and      ┃ Religion compared ┃
commands, and that you must obey those commands. On   ┃ to a virus        ┃
what evidence do you base that belief? How can        ┃ The desire for a  ┃
anyone ever know that God spoke to him? Even more,    ┃ father figure     ┃
how can anyone ever know that God spoke to some       ┃ Bible: who wrote  ┃
other person?                                         ┃ it?               ┃

  • Take it on trust?                                 ┃ Where is God?     ┃
  • It's in the Torah (or Bible or Koran),            ┃ Age of the earth  ┃
    therefore it must be true?                        ┃ Paganism          ┃
  • Many people tell me it's true? (I like the        ┃ Animal cruelty    ┃

In the twenty-first century we know that one of the   ┃ On other pages... ┃
symptoms of schizophrenia is the hearing of           ┃ The Bible         ┃
imaginary voices. Isn't it likely that those who      ┃ Is God real?      ┃

Those who call themselves Christian Scientists take
as a premise the literal truth of the Bible and
pick and choose those scientific discoveries that
seem to support their case, while trying to
discredit any science or scientist that, they feel,
opposes them or their beliefs. Those who call
themselves Intelligent Creationists similarly take
it as true that God created life and then look for
evidence supporting their case. These people try to
legitimise their beliefs by linking them to
science, but at the same time they remove the basis
of science – an open mind.

Anyone who bases their life on a belief for which
they have no evidence can, with justification, be
thought either very foolish or even mad.

Since Martin Luther started the Lutheran Church and broke away
from the Catholic Church there have been many other people and
groups forming branches of the Christian religion. Why are
there no break-away Christian groups, other than the Eastern
Orthodox, that date back from the institutionisation of
Christianity by Emperor Theodosius around 390AD to 1517 when
Luther produced his 95 Theses? This is a period of over 1100
years.

There are no surviving break-away groups because the groups
that did break-away were sooner or later ruthlessly forced back
into the main-stream, with the authorities often using torture
or execution on those who resisted. They were called heretics
and were forced to believe, or at least to pretend to believe,
the dogma held by the dominant group. The early Church
eradicated many so-called heresies, including Docetism,
Montanism, Adoptionism, Sabellianism, Arianism, Pelagianism,
and Gnosticism. Other break-away groups who have been
eliminated included the Pneumatomachians and Priscilliansts of
the 4th century; the Donatists, 5th cent; and the Albigensians,
12th and 13th centuries.

Some of the heresies and schisms

  • The Montanist movement broke away in the second century,
    flourished in the third, had almost died out (or been
    killed off) by the sixth century.
  • The Ebionite movement originated in the first century.
    Little information survives.
  • The Donatists broke with the majority church in 312. It
    seems that Islam had more to do with the extinction of the
    Donatist church in the early Middle Ages than did
    Christianity.
  • Docetism rejected the humanity of Christ; the Docetics have
    gone the way of many other 'heresies'.
  • Arianism began in the forth century and held that Christ
    was not truly devine but was a created being. This 'heresy'
    was condemned by the Council of Nicaea (325 AD) and it was
    wiped out of both the Eastern and Western Roman Empires
    shortly after 381. It survived among some of the Germanic
    tribes until the end of the seventh century.
  • The Paulicians originated in the mid-seventh century. They
    held that Jesus was not truly the son of Mary. Paulicianism
    was repressed by Constantine III, Justinian II, Michal I
    and the empress Theodora; in spite of this it survived at
    least well into the ninth century.
  • The Schism of 1054, also called the East-West Schism, in
    which the Eastern Christian churches broke away from the
    Western (Catholic) Church, was the only successful bid for
    independence between 390 and 1517AD. The reason it succeded
    is that each group was supported by strong and independent
    geographically-based power blocs.
  • The Cathari was a major break-away branch of Christianity
    that flourished in western Europe in the 12th and 13th
    centuries; they were persecuted into extinction over a
    period of several hundred years.
  • Peter Waldo (or Valdo) preached around 1170-76; his
    followers (Waldenses) were persecuted and executed to the
    point of near extinction by the end of the 13th century.
  • Jan Hus, a 15th century Czech religious reformer in some
    ways anticipated the Lutheran Reformation by a century.
    However, Hus was less successful than Luther, and was
    burned at the stake in 1415.

It seems that many of the 'heretical' groups rebelled against
the corruption in the Catholic hierarchy as much as against
Catholic theology. The history of the 'heresies' of the
Catholic Church up to the Reformation makes fascinating
reading; but is not for the fainthearted.

After Martin Luther (1483 to 1546) there were wars in Europe
between Protestants and Catholics for hundreds of years, each
group trying to force their beliefs onto the other. Many of
those who migrated to the New World did so to escape religious
persecution.

Pope Pius V caused the Inquisition to eliminate Protestantism
from Italy during his reign (1566-72); it is hard to imagine
how much torture and killing would be involved in such a
campaign. He was canonized (made a saint) in 1712 (an act
similar in its injustice to the nomination of George W. Bush
for the Nobel Peace Prize).

Christians force their beliefs onto the general community by
making voluntary euthanasia illegal

In the modern world most laws aim at keeping the peace and
making people treat each other fairly. There are some laws,
however, that are forced on all the people of various nations
by Christian lobby groups and are based on Christian dogma
rather than ethics.

Few people would believe it ethical to keep an animal alive if
it was in great pain and suffering from an incurable disease or
terribly injured. What is the point in prolonging life in that
situation? It amounts to cruelty, and in many countries anybody
keeping an animal alive in great pain could be prosecuted for
mistreating the animal. Many people – the great majority in my
country, Australia – feel that if they were in that position
they should have the right to ask that their life be ended.

Few countries allow people the legal right to have their life
ended rather than suffer intolerable pain or mental
deterioration. There is no ethical justification for this
prohibition, it is largely due to Christian and other bigots
forcing their beliefs onto the remainder of the population.

Christians do, and should, have the right to die in great and
prolonged pain if that is what they want, but they have no
right to force it onto anyone else. John Stuart Mill argued
famously in On Liberty,

    "The only part of the conduct of any one, for which [a
    citizen] is amenable to society, is that which concerns
    others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his
    independence is, of right, absolute. Over himself, over his
    own body and mind, the individual is sovereign."

... or should be!

Some are opposed to voluntary euthanasia on the basis of the
'slippery slope' argument; that if it is allowed in cases where
it is truely voluntary, euthanasia will later come to be
pressed onto those whose relatives want to get them out of the
way, or who the state considers to be socially undesirable. The
same argument could be used to put the case that the state
should never punish anyone; on the ground that a punishment
such as a fine or a period of deprivation of liberty will
eventually grow into locking up indefinitely all those who are
considered socially undesirable.

Consider voluntary euthanasia in terms of simple ethics: what
harm is done, and what good is done?

  • If a person is kept alive in great pain and against his
    will certainly a wrong is being committed; unnecessary
    suffering is being forced onto a sentient being.
  • This must be balanced against the possibility of the misuse
    of voluntary euthanasia: where if the laws are taken
    advantage of by bad people with their own agenda and all
    the safeguards that have been put in place are
    circumvented, and the medical professionals involved are
    complicit in the crime, a person may be killed against his
    will.

In the former case there is a very definite wrong, in the
latter case there is a chance of a wrong being done if the
system is allowed to become badly corrupted. Surely we should
choose the apparently small chance of a wrong, if we do allow
VE, as being much preferable to the quite definite wrong, if we
continue to ban VE!

I have written on this point in its specific application to
Australia elsewhere.

The prohibition of abortion in many cases is similarly due to
Christians forcing their beliefs onto others.

Religion is a superstition

The greatest of the self deceptions, religion, is so widely
accepted that it is rarely classed as a superstition at all. In
the past religion has served two main purposes: it provided an
explanation for the way the world is, and it provided a father
figure for Man.

It is in the nature of people to look for an explanation, to
want to understand. In the distant past one can imagine people
wondering why prey animals were easier to find one year than
the next, why a usually reliable edible root plant was in short
supply some years or in some areas, why rains were plentiful
sometimes, scarce other times, excessive occasionally. Some
things they would have been able to understand: in an
excessively cold year many prey animals were found dead (it was
reasonable to suppose the cold had killed them, just as it
could kill a person exposed to the cold); in another year the
wet season rains were sparse and wild wheat was also scarce (it
was easy to see that wheat needed soil water in order to grow).

Many other observations would not come with explanations: how
could a plant come from a seed? – surely there must be some
great and wonderful process involved here; what caused
diseases? – fellow humans sometimes caused harm to each other,
could diseases be caused by humans with supernatural powers, or
by some sort of humanoid spirit? Wherever they went the Sun
would be there every day and disappear every night; it
obviously must be very big, very far away, very powerful. What
could move a thing so big and powerful, or was the Sun itself
alive? The stars moved across the sky each night; what power
moved them? What caused the wind to blow and storms to come?
The concept of a god, or a pantheon of gods, could explain a
great many otherwise unexplainable observations.

From our earliest memories we (most of us) have had authority
figures to protect us, provide for us and make the hard
decisions. In our infancies probably our greatest insecurities
involve fear of losing our parents. It can be a shock to
realise, on becoming an adult, that we have to make our own
decisions. Some of us use a god to fill the role of a father
figure so that we never have to take full responsibility for
our own actions.

Reward and punishment in religion

In at least the Judeo-Christian-Islamic group of religions
adherents are lead to believe that God will hand out justice in
the next life; we will be punished or rewarded for our
behaviour in this life after we have died.

Anyone who has successfully raised a child or trained a dog
will be aware of the need for feedback. The child is rewarded
with a kind word when it does something we approve of and
growled at when it deserves our disapproval; the dog is given a
small food treat when it successfully understands and obeys a
command, and is admonished when it breaks the rules.

The need for this, and its purpose, is obvious – feedback. The
child or the dog is continually reminded that when it does
wrong it meats with disapproval, whenever it does good that
good is rewarded.

Yet in religion we must believe that God doesn't ever give us
any feedback. We have to take it on faith that people like
Hitler and Stalin, who caused enormous misery and death on
earth, received their just rewards after their own deaths, and
we have to believe, without evidence, that the good people of
the past have been rewarded in Heaven. Wouldn't God's purpose
be much better served if he informed us of the justice that was
actually handed out to people who we knew, or knew of, in the
afterlife? Wouldn't he achieve his purpose much better if he
handed out reward and punishment soon after the deeds that
called for judgement? It seems, if he exists, he doesn't know
much about human behaviour.

Religion compared to a virus

There are similarities between religion and a contagious
disease such as those caused by viruses.

 1. A virus is forced by its genes to reproduce. If a religion
    is to be successful it too must reproduce (spread).
 2. People can 'catch' a religion from those around them and
    then pass it on to others; the similarity to a virus here
    is obvious. A successful religion is highly contagious. Its
    adherents actively try to convert others. It has a message
    that is appealing and often gives hope for a better life
    (quite probably after death). The adherents of several
    religions have actively forced people to convert a number
    of times in history.
 3. The most successful religions get a strong grip on their
    adherents from several angles: fear of punishment, hope for
    reward, and the provision of a father figure. Those who
    have long belonged to a religion are terrified when they
    begin to doubt because they are threatened with damnation
    (or other punishment in the afterlife or later
    incarnations). The most successful viruses use various
    means to avoid being overrun by the body's defences, they
    might periodically change features of their outer coating
    so that they are difficult to recognize, they might mutate
    frequently (the common cold, for example), so that immunity
    to one cold doesn't stop you catching the next version.
    Both viruses and religions have developed ways to stop
    people from defending themselves against infection.
 4. The most successful religions, like the most successful
    diseases, don't do their hosts a lot of harm. A disease
    that quickly kills its victims is not likely to be passed
    on. Similarly, a religion that required all children to be
    sacrificed, or universal celibacy, could not last. The most
    successful religions allow most of their adherents to live
    a pretty 'normal' life. Again, the common cold is a good
    example, it thrives in its numerous hosts, but kills very
    few.
 5. Computer viruses are not so clever as religions. There is
    obviously no advantage in having a virus in your computer.
    If someone created a virus that did come with advantages,
    then it would be much more likely to spread. If a virus has
    only disadvantages and can be recognised then we can crush
    it. If a religion had only disadvantages we would not adopt
    it.
 6. Viruses must breed to be successful. Religions often
    encourage their adherents to have many children and
    discourage abortion and family planning.

Memes are ideas, methods, or skills that we learn from each
other; most of them are useful, even valuable. In a sense they
are heritable, like genes, we discover them and pass them on to
acquaintances and to later generations. Religion is a parasitic
meme, a meme that uses the gullibility of humans to hold onto
its adherents and to spread to others.

The photos on the right show several of the animal benches at

They show a humour that is entirely missing in the Religions of
the Book (Judaism, Christianity and Islam). I cannot imagine
benches like these outside of a Christian church, even less a
Muslim mosque.

The Religions of the Book seem obsessed with sin, punishment
and fear of God. Humour has no place in them.

If one must believe religious clap-trap Buddhism is at least a

The desire for a father (or mother) figure

When we are young most of us can go to our parents if we are
unsure of something, if we need advice, or if we feel
inadequate for some challenge. As we grow up we take on more
responsibility for our own welfare, we become more independent;
but I suspect that the desire to have a mentor or protector to
whom we can go to when life is hard or complex remains in most
of us for a very long time, perhaps all our lives. Similarly,
we would sometimes like to avoid having to make hard decisions
on our own, we would prefer to have someone in higher
authority, someone who we know has our best interests at heart,
make the hard decisions for us – and, importantly, accept the
responsibility for those decisions. God serves these
father-figure purposes for many people.

So belief in, and submission to, a god can be a way of 'passing
the buck', of being able to say, "It was not my decision, I
followed God's dictates". What then, if there is no god, or if
your god happens to be the wrong one (only one faith, at most,
can be correct)? Then the believer is trying to pass
responsibility for critically important decisions onto ideas
written centuries ago by people who were fundamentally in error
in their main premise!

There is a long history of arguments about what writings should
be accepted as Christian scripture. People involved include
Melito (2nd century), Origen (2nd and 3rd century), Athanasius
(4th century), Jerome and Augustine (4th & 5th century). The
subject seems to have gone quiet during the Dark Ages, but then
re-emerged in the renaissance and reformation especially among
the newly emerged Protestant faiths.

Curiously, the great majority of twentieth century Christians
seem willing to accept the bible that their particular branch
of the faith provides them with, as it stands, without
question. It is accepted as true, or even "God's Word", because
someone, they don't know whom, has passed it on to them as
such. A remarkable demonstration of apathy and/or naivete'!

I think this point is worth repeating; the Bible is accepted by
the great majority of Christians as coming from God because
someone, or many people, have told them that it did!

"If a thousand people say a foolish thing, it is still a
foolish thing." Chinese proverb

Questions that are rarely asked by Christians, and yet are
fundamental, are:

  • Who decided what writings went into the Bible?
  • On what grounds were some writings accepted and others
    rejected?
  • When were these decisions made?
  • Should they ever be reviewed?

How can intelligent human beings accept the Bible as the Word
of God – and base their lives on it – without asking, and
finding adequate answers to, these questions?

The undeniable fact is that the Bible was written by people.
Some Christians may well claim that these people had divine
guidance, but still, the Bible was written by people. Did other
people decide which writers were guided by God, and which
weren't; and include or exclude writings accordingly? Did they
too have divine guidance? In what form did this divine guidance
come? How can we know that it was divine? Did God provide more
and surer guidance in ancient times than he does now? Why?

A few modern Christians have asked probing questions. Ian
Wilson discusses the evidence for the existence and 'divinity'
of Jesus in an objective way in his interesting and well
written book, 'Jesus: The Evidence'.

Creation science
(Intelligent design by another name)

Science is the application of the scientific method. A
definition of the scientific method goes something like this:

 1. An observation, or more likely a series of observations,
    are made;
 2. An hypothesis is produced, that, supposing it to be true,
    would explain the observation(s);
 3. Experiments are devised to test the hypothesis;
 4. If the experiments fail to disprove the hypothesis then it
    can become a scientific theory.

Note that the theory need not be proven (usually it cannot be
proven), but every test that it passes increases its standing.
A hypothesis that cannot be tested is considered to be of
dubious value.

Creation 'science' is different. Its adherents hold the belief
that biblical creation happened. From there they look for
evidence that seems to support their belief and ignore evidence
that tends to contradict their dogma.

The term 'creation science' is an oxymoron. Either one believes
in creation as described in the Bible, or one believes that the
scientific method can be used to inform us about how the world
came to be the way it is and how it works. One cannot accept,
unquestioningly, Biblical creation, and believe that the world
is amenable to scientific investigation.

Either the universe can be understood by using observation and
reasoning or God is running it and it is intrinsically
incapable of being explained by reason. Either there are causes
and effects that we can understand by learning rules and laws,
or not. It seems to me that science has explained an enormous
amount of how the universe works; I see no reason to believe
that the theory of evolution should be discarded in favour of
'creation science'.

'Intelligent design' is a similar belief to Creation science.
It also looks for and considers only the evidence that is
favourable to the preconceptions of its adherents. See also the
third and equally valid alternative to science, Flying
Spaghetti Monsterism.

Where is God?

A thousand years ago people assumed that God and Heaven were
somewhere up above us, hence the use of the term 'the heavens'
for the realm of astronomy. They also imagined that Hell was
down in 'the bowels of the Earth' somewhere.

Astronomy has shown no trace of Heaven or some home for God in
the heavens – all is stars, gas, dust, galaxies, etc; and
geology has shown us that there is no Hell down beneath our
feet – there is the rocky crust, the denser rocky mantle, then
the metallic core of the Earth.

So where is God? Where are we to believe that our souls go
after we die? Some sort of fairyland?

Age of the earth

Those who attempt to uphold a literal interpretation of the
Bible would have us believe that the earth is about six
thousand years old.

One need have only a very basic knowledge of geology to look at
a landscape and see that it could not have become the way it is
by the action of natural forces in six thousand years. It takes
too long for streams to cut out valleys, for sediments to form
in lakes or lagoons, for ice ages to come and go, for granites
to crystallise from a magma, and for many other processes.

Similarly, astronomy shows us that the Universe is billions of
years old.

  ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
  ┃ We could have all   ┃
  ┃ been created ten    ┃
  ┃ minutes ago,        ┃
  ┃ together with a     ┃
  ┃ Universe made to    ┃
  ┃ look like it is     ┃
  ┃ billions of years   ┃
  ┃ old and with our    ┃
  ┃ memories            ┃
  ┃ appropriately       ┃
  ┃ filled with false   ┃
  ┃ recollections; but  ┃
  ┃ why would you       ┃
  ┃ believe that? Is it ┃
  ┃ any less rational   ┃
  ┃ that believing the  ┃
  ┃ Universe is six     ┃
  ┃ thousand years old? ┃
  ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛

So, if God created the world six thousand years ago he must
have made a conscious decision to make it look like it was much
more than six thousand years old. Why would he do that? To
deliberately confuse us? Yet we are to believe he is a good
god?

Ever since William of Ockham stated his principle, Ockham's
Razor, in the early fourteenth century, philosophers and
scientists have found that, as a general rule, a simpler
explanation is to be preferred to a complex one if both are
equally successful in other ways. The earth could be the way it
is now due to the natural processes that we can observe around
us, or it could be that a God (who cannot be shown to exist)
created it much as it is today six thousand years ago, and took
a great deal of trouble to make it look as if it is billions of
years old. The same can be said for the Universe.

Paganism

In the twenty-first century you don't need to follow one of the
long established religions, you can make up your own religion.
You can select any combination from a smorgasbord of old gods
and beliefs, or you can start entirely from scratch.

Do your own thing. It is no more stupid than following any
other belief that has no evidentiary backing.

You won't be burned at the stake or hung as a witch; at least
not until some single religion again reaches supremacy and its
adherents, as religious people are wont to do if they are able,
start forcing their beliefs on their neighbours.

Animal cruelty in the name of religion

Humane societies electrically stun animals before they are
killed by cutting their throats. Judaism and Islam, by Kosher
and Halal food handling rules respectively, require that
animals be killed by having their throats cut – without the
humane stunning first.

It seems that the God of the Torah and the Koran didn't know
that electrical stunning would be more humane. As mentioned
elsewhere on this site, divine revelation didn't reveal
anything that was of any use to anyone.
