Our group is a social outlet and a gathering of inquiring minds that feel free
to share ideas without dogma. We accept anyone who has doubt about the
existence of gods, a few of us however are completely convinced that no gods
exist, so let your thoughts be known and we can discuss your point of view.

We're 906 Atheists
