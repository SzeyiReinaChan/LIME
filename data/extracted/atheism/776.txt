                                  [console2]
                                       



      This is the collection of my views on subjects I consider important.
      While they all may not be bible bashing spews, they will all refer to
      topics I feel need to be adressed by Atheists and Humanists. They are
      by all means not the do all end all, but are intended to express my
      opinion.
