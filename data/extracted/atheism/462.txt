Hi- We are a group of like minded people who get together to talk about
whatever interests us. Trivia, science fiction, the arts, technology, books,
philosophy, movies...you name it. 

But we don't believe in a god or gods....Simple as that.

Oh!  and we have membership dues. 

Yep... 10 bucks a year. Payable to the organizer at any meetup or online.  The
dues will cover the cost of the meetup site and if we go over the yearly
website costs we'll put the extra funds into a party or picnic for those who
paid for that year. 

If this is cool with you,  feel free to join us..looking forward to meeting
you!


Mike
