The Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., is an educational group working for
the separation of state and church. Its purposes, as stated in its bylaws, are
to promote the constitutional principle of separation of state and church, and
to educate the public on matters relating to nontheism.

Incorporated in 1978 in Wisconsin, the Foundation is a national membership
association of freethinkers: atheists, agnostics and skeptics of any pedigree.
The Foundation is a non-profit, tax-exempt organization under Internal Revenue
Code 501(c)(3). All dues and contributions are deductible for income tax
purposes.
