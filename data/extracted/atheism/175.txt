                 "Creationism is not the alternative to Evolution - ignorance
                                              is"

                                            ~~~~~~

                "I worry that, especially as the Millennium edges nearer,
                pseudoscience and superstition will seem year by year more
                tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and
                attractive. Where have we heard it before? Whenever our ethnic
                or national prejudices are aroused, in times of scarcity,
                during challenges to national self-esteem or nerve, when we
                agonize about our diminished cosmic place and purpose, or when
                fanaticism is bubbling up around us - then, habits of thought
                familiar from ages past reach for the controls. The candle
                flame gutters. Its little pool of light trembles. Darkness
                gathers. The demons begin to stir."
                --Carl Sagan, "The Demon-Haunted World", pp. 26-27.

                                            ~~~~~~

                "...be on guard against giving interpretations of Scripture
                that are far fetched or opposed to science, and so exposing the
                Word of God to the ridicule of unbelievers."
                --Saint Augustine

                                            ~~~~~~

                "Evolution, simply put, is descent with modification. This
                definition encompasses
                small-scale evolution (changes in gene frequency in a
                population from one generation to the next) and large-scale
                evolution (the descent of different species from a common
                ancestor over many generations). Evolution helps us to
                understand the history of life."

            public.  It is intended to provide 'one-stop shopping' for
            evolution education.  The web site is rich in content, with
            sections on the nature of science, evolution itself, the different
            lines of evidence supporting evolution, evolution's relevance to
            everyday life, widespread misconceptions about evolution, and the
            history of evolutionary thought.  There is also an extensive
            section especially for teachers, giving advice on teaching
            evolution, ideas for lesson plans, ways to avoid confusing
            students, and answering common student questions.)
