Interested in discussing religion from a non-dogmatic point of view? Curious
about other points of view? Sometimes wonder if what you've heard about
religions seems a bit far-fetched? Ever wondered if the stories from religions
are based on true events? Join us as we delve into these questions and more in
a friendly, open atmosphere where different perspectives are welcome and no
opinions are anathema. Potential topics: the documentary hypothesis, the
historical Jesus, the synoptic problem, textual criticism, dating and
authorship, comparative theology, etc.
