Tree of Knowledge battle in West Chester

By Sapient - Posted on November 21st, 2010

Carol Everhart Roper has all the details on the Tree of Knowledge this year,
here is a snip:

    West Chester, PA is a lovely, historically important town. Some years back,
    Newsweek voted it as one of the top ten small towns to live in. I live
    here, and I understand, and agree. It's really a wonderful place, most of
    the time.

    You might recall that this is the courthouse building which proudly
    displays a bronze Ten Commandments plaque by the front door - and won a
    legal challenge by closing that door to traffic and calling the plaque
    'historic' not 'religious'.

    It's also the birthplace of the Tree of Knowledge winter holiday display.
    The ToK has been a symbol of non-theist participation in the holidays, and
    as such, has given non-theists and other believers who treasure learning
    and knowledge a public representation of their own.

    The Story Behind the Story

    The public is invited to hear Freethought Society president Margaret Downey
    on Monday, November 15, 2010 at 7:00 PM in the Community Room of the
    Norristown Library (1001 Powell Street, Norristown, Pennsylvania).

    Downey’s presentation “The Story Behind the Story” will highlight her
    journey from being baptized Catholic to becoming an outspoken and proud
    leader in the nontheist community. The presentation is a continuation of
    the essay “My ‘Bye Bull’ Story” which was originally published in 50 Voices
    of Disbelief: Why We Are Atheists.

    This presentation will include a PowerPoint slide show and essay creation
    literature.

    Downey is a national atheist speaker. Her presentations receive rave
    reviews. Below is commentary from people who have attended this
    presentation:

    “You delivered a great presentation to the Freethinkers of Colorado Springs
    last week! I am still getting phone calls and emails from members and
    "drop-ins" complimenting me on your presentation and thanking me for
    bringing you to town. Thanks again for your tireless devotion to
    freethought and for sharing your time with us.”

    Becky Hale, Freethinkers of Colorado Springs

    Will atheist groups agree to a Unity Convention?

    By Sapient - Posted on January 6th, 2010

    For several years Margaret Downey has been suggesting an Atheist Unity
    Convention in which many atheist groups unite to form a single convention
    in that year. Groups such as CFI, American Atheists, FFRF, AHA, AAI and
    others would get together for one big convention.

    This weekend Margaret will try to get enough support from the host
    organizations to go ahead with this goal. If you would like to see such an
    event, you should contact the President of the organization you belong to
    and express interest.

    Here are two articles about The Unity Convention:
    Friendly Atheist on Unity Convention.
    PZ Myers on Unity Convention
    Staks on Unity Convention

    Hemant on Unity Convention from 2008

    VIDEO: The Tree of Knowledge 7 mins (by Brian Sapient) 2009

    By Sapient - Posted on December 1st, 2009

    http://video.rationalresponders.com/video/Tree-of-Knowledge-2009

    Thoughts from yesterday when we put the tree up:

    "The TREE OF KNOWLEDGE is up, installed on the south lawn of the Chester
    County Courthouse in the heart of West Chester - right next to the creche
    display. Margaret Downey, Brian Sapient, two brothers, Nicholas and Ian
    Stark, another young man named Andrew and I worked some five hours in the
    steady rain and mud but we were successful!" - Carol Everhart Roper on
    Facebook

    [Margaret Downey was] "cold, wet and tired after a full day at the Chester
    County Courthouse installing the Tree of Knowledge. Time for some hot tea
    and warm bath. The tree looks great and I am so grateful to the volunteers
    who helped today. The rain did not deter us." - Margaret Downey on Facebook

    Notable Quotes

    "Constructive criticism is necessary for growth and improvement, but we
    must also take the time to extend compliments. Compliments are necessary
    for growth in that they are positive reinforcements of an asset.
    Compliments must be sincere, however. If you are not sincere in your
    appreciation of an asset, you'll sound like a phony, and nobody likes a
    phony."
