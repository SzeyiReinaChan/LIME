    A nontheistic and nonreligious opposition to the life-denying horror of
                                   abortion

          "... because life is all there is and all that matters, and
            abortion destroys the life of an innocent human being."

                This site was last modified on 1 January 2007.

I'm James Matthew (Matt) Wallace, aka The Compleat Heretic. I'm both a Secular
Humanist atheist and a pro-life advocate. All too often, I fear that I'm the
only nonreligious person who opposes the genocide of abortion used as a birth
control substitute. Accordingly, I have created this web site as a virtual
rallying point and clearinghouse for all atheists, agnostics, and other
"godless" people who call themselves "pro-life."

Though I am a Republican and a conservative (both social and economic), I
intend for this site to be nonpartisan and nondiscriminatory. AAPL is for all
nontheists regardless of political affiliation, political alignment, age,
gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, etc.; the more
diversity, all the better. Even so, there are three requirements (explained in
further detail on the Membership Form page) for AAPL membership; one must:

    1) be an avowed atheist, agnostic, or other nontheist
    2) oppose abortion and desire its abolition (with or without exceptions)
    3) support nonviolence as the sole legitimate means of achieving the goals
    of the
        pro-life movement

All I have at present is this modest web site. In future, I intend to expand it
further. To this end, I welcome input from other nontheistic pro-lifers (or any
of our guests for that matter) as to the features they would like to see.
Please feel free to direct suggestions, comments, and queries to me.
