Freethinkers of Northern Colorado

FNC (Freethinkers of Northern Colorado) is an organization that supports a
positive view of atheism to our local community and to the world. We provide a
place for families to get together and socialize, to engage in activism, and
gain emotional support -- to help freethinkers and atheists feel less isolated
in a predominately religious world. We promote the separation of state and
church, encourage atheist activism and charitable works, and educate on
freethinking, atheism and religion.

How To Support FNC

Membership
So, you think FNC is the greatest thing since the Enlightenment and want to be
a member?  Well, we would love to have you!

Being a member is really reasonable.  We do it basically so we just know that
you love us.  It's only $1 per year, payable at the first meeting of the year
that you attend.   But we do have a membership application; email us at
freethinkersofnorthernco (at) gmail (dot) com with your mailing or e-mail
address if you would like to apply.

Benefits
Members of FNC receive voting privileges, not to mention the undying gratitude
of the officers that you elect. You will also enjoy participation in and
socializing during our meetings, discussion groups, parties, and picnics, and
the heady sense of power and egoism that the privilege will bring you.

Privacy Policy
Here's the fine print.  The FNC membership list will never be released to
another organization or non-member. However, the Colorado non-profit law
requires that members' names and addresses be made available to other members
upon request.

What more could you want as a freethinker?  Come join us today!

Welcome to FNC's new website!

Welcome to the new website of the Freethinkers of Northern Colorado.  Glad you

Here, you can keep up with all our group happenings, read about past events,
and find out where our next events will be held.

Our normal monthly meeting is held on the 3rd Sunday of the month from 10:00am

Our meetings are usually in an "open chat" forum. But some months we plan a
picnic or other alternative activity, so it's important to check our website
