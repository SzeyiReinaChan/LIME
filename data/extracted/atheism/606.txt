Get Connected, Get Involved

Brandeis has more than 250 student-run clubs and organizations, including
service organizations, cultural awareness groups, performing groups, spiritual
and religious groups, sports and games clubs, student leadership and activism
groups, student publications, a television station (BTV) and a radio station
(WBRS).

One of the main centers for student activities on campus is the Shapiro Campus
Center, a $28-million, limestone and copper landmark that houses student
organization offices, a theater for undergraduate productions, a bookstore, a
cafe', computer clusters and lounges with fireplaces.

The Undergraduate Student Union is the student governmental body that advocates
for students and provides club support.  It is comprised of an Executive Board,
the Union Senate, the Finance Board, and University Judiciary.  They are
located on the third floor of the Shapiro Campus Center in Room 301.
