The Ethical Humanist Society welcomes people from many different backgrounds
and traditions. Whether you call yourself a Humanist, Free Thinker, a Bright,
an Atheist, an Agnostic, a Pastafarian or want no label at all you are welcome
to join us.

Discussions and programs are varied. Sometimes meetings include a speaker and
sometimes it is just a time for fellowship with like minded people. We try to
keep it interesting and uplifting. Our focus is upon the ethical values people
have in common, rather than what keeps humans apart.

Our regular meetings are currently at the Hardee's, 2611 W Mason St, Green Bay
on Sunday mornings at 10:00 AM. 

While we are The Ethical Humanist Society of Green Bay Wisconsin (EHSGBW) we
will be happy to schedule alternate or parallel events for members anywhere in
WI or the UP. Hopefully through cooperation and common purpose many local
groups will become self sustaining.
