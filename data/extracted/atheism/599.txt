Non-theist News – The Callout is Here!

Posted on January 27, 2014 by Purdue Non-Theists
Reply

We need your help! Plenty of events are in the scheduling process. We need
volunteers for Ask an Atheist tabling  and our Send and Atheist to Church
fundraiser (coming up soon). If you want to be more involved please let the new
President (Nick McNeely) or the Treasurer (Serena Ostrander) know via email or
Facebook. We can’t put on these events without you!

These events will be discussed at our upcoming call out. Which reminds me…

Upcoming Club Events

Spring Callout!
Wednesday January 29, 7:00 PM at Class of 1950 121
Wednesday the 29th will be our official Spring Callout! If you’re interested in
any facets of non-theism, care about church-state separation, or just want to
hang out without constant Bible-study invitations, come meet us all in person
and learn about the club.  Pizza and soda will be provided for all.
(Facebook Event)

Feast of the Godless: Pappy’s Sweet Shop
Sunday, February 2, 7:00 PM at Pappy’s in the Union

Tuesday, February 4, 6:50-9:30 PM, Location TBA
Science popularizer Bill Nye (the Science Guy) will debate Ken Ham (CEO of
Answers in Genesis) on the question, “Is creation a viable model of origins?” 
We are looking for a classroom where we can gather to  laugh/cringe at
creationist rhetoric.  Join us for some fun!
(Facebook Event).

Invited Speaker Phil Ferguson: Breaking the Cycle of Religion
Wednesday February 5, 7:00 PM at Class of 1950 121
Phil Ferguson is a long time skeptic/atheist and avid supporter of those
movements.  He is a board member of Secular Student Alliance (we’re an SSA
affiliate!) and blogger at Skeptic Money.  He is determined to help children
get free from religion and will discuss “Breaking the Cycle of Religion,” in
which he explores religious trends among young adults and suggests subtle ways
to instill healthy skepticism in your family.  After the talk, we will
socialize with Phil over dinner (TBA).
(Facebook Event)

Upcoming Campus Events

This Friday marks the beginning of the Symposium Christi conference, an annual
event hosted by campus and community religious groups in the Purdue Memorial
Union.  Its goal is “to explore and debate some of the most probing questions
about faith, reason, and life via panel discussions, lectures, and debates.”

Though the club is not involved in the conference, we have made Facebook event
pages for those interested in meeting with other non-theists to attend talks.

Friday, January 31
“On Being a CHRISTIAN Professor” (FB)
“Three Arguments for the Dependence of Morality upon Religion” (FB)
Saturday, February 1
“What Would Jesus Do? What Would Darwin Do? A Dialogue Concerning Radical
Social Injustice” (FB)
“Sex and God at College” (Includes Q & A) (FB)

Upcoming Events

Weekly Meeting: Activism Planning Night
Wednesday, October 30th, 7:00 PM at Stone 217
Rather than hosting a discussion, we will be meeting to decide future
directions for the club. During this session we will brainstorm ideas,
messages, slogans, and activities, protests, and/or demonstrations to make our
voices heard.  Why speak up, you ask?  There are  many issues on campus worthy
of pursuit.  The decision of which issues we tackle lies with you.  We will
pick our battles and decide the best course of action for each.  We can do
anything from counter-protests, chalking campaigns, or even put on events with
other organizations.

Some current issues: The abortion debate is in full swing on campus; you’ve
probably seen the misleading and inaccurate statements by pro-life preachers on
campus. We could also plan activities to support our allies in the LGBTQ
Student Association and the Episcopal Student Association.  We can publicize
the effects religious privilege and examine the research on marginalization of
non-theists on campus. The list goes on and on.  This is your chance to choose
the club’s direction.  Come make your voices heard and bring suggestions for
topics and activities.   Share what pisses you off.  Together we might just be
able to do something about it.
