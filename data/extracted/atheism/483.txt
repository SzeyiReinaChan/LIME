The Concord Area Humanists are a casual and inclusive collection of Humanists
and secularists of all types from the Concord area in Massachusetts. We meet
several times a month to discuss topics related to Humanism. Humanism is a
progressive philosophy of life that, without supernaturalism, affirms our
ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that
aspire to the greater good of humanity.

You can learn more about us at our main website:
