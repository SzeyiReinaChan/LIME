The state of atheist blogging

Evan, at On the way to Ithaca, the blog of a Greek atheist, wrote an article on
the state of atheist blogging. The stats break down to active
(ενεργά),  inactive (ανενεργά) and no longer existent (ανύπαρκτα). I do not
think the results paint a healthy picture. 
Evan says the work took in about four hours. I am grateful for the effort.
Thank Evan! I have not updated The Atheist Blogroll since Jan 26, 2014. With my
professional obligations, I do not have the time to dedicate to the task. 
If a few interested atheists would like to join me in an effort to revitalize
the list, drop me a email. I would be happy to get it going again; even if we
just list all active atheist blogs as a resource for the community.

I'm purging inactive members

I must apologize. I've been sick for the last two weeks so activity on The
Atheist Blogroll has been limited. I did another 50 blogs this morning. Blogs
that are marked "Gone" no longer resolve. "Inactive" blogs have not had a post
in the last year or have clearly stated that they are inactive. "Active" blogs
have posts in the last year. Here are the results.
