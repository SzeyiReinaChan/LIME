Welcome! Yes, there are freethinkers, agnostics, atheists, skeptics, etc.
behind the "Zion Curtain."

Atheists of Utah (AOU) is an independent, democratically-run, non-profit
membership organization. Our main objective is to provide a social community
where non-theists can come together and mingle with other like-minded people.

In addition to the weekly coffee chats, AOU hosts Good Without God monthly
volunteer night, quarterly membership parties, Pride Festival booth and parade
participation, camping trips, movie screenings, Hogle Zoo tours, and lots of
other fun activities. We also have an Adopt A Highway section on State Street
(Highway 89) in Salt Lake City.

Stay tuned here for more information on upcoming events. Or connect with us on
our Facebook Page, Facebook Group, Twitter, Google+, or via our Official
Website.
