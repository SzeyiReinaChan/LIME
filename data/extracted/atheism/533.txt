Don't believe in God?

You are not alone!

[event_73349662]

It is an exciting time to be a nonbeliever in the U.S. There are more people
shedding dogma and religion in this country than at any other time in the past.
Membership in atheist organizations is growing steadily and more people are
standing up for their rights to be free from religion. The formation of the LFS
is in response to the desire of Lancaster area free thinkers to become a part
of this growing movement.

What is a Freethinker?
A freethinker is one who forms opinions about religion, independently of
tradition, dogma, authority or established belief, in favor of rational
inquiry.


Our goals:

- Provide a social and intellectual community for freethinkers and their
families.
- Enrich and empower our membership through education and activism
- Educate the public about non-theists and church-state separation
- Teach critical thinking skills and promote reason
- Defend and promote the separation of church and state

Community is the primary goal of the Lancaster Freethought Society. We strive
to provide a community in the Lancaster area for Atheists, Agnostics, Secular
Humanists, Skeptics, and Freethinkers of every stripe. Without a strong
community, none of our other goals are possible to achieve. Whether you are
still in closet about your atheism or loud and proud, you are welcome to join
our friendly community.

Charity is another of LFS’s goals. We will search for ways to help our local
community and help put a positive face on atheism. Some of these activities
will be “Adopt a Highway” clean-ups, food drives, an “Ask An Atheist” booth at
Lancaster Central Market, and participation in local festivals. We want to
dispel the public perception of atheists as immoral self-centered people and
secure a positive place in the hearts and minds of the community.


Family is important to LFS. One of the things that religion does so well is to
create a social support system and a sense of community for its members. LFS
wants to fill this role for nonbelievers in the Lancaster area. If you are sick
in the hospital, a member might be able to visit or watch your kids while your
significant other goes grocery shopping. If you lost your job, LFS might be
able to assist you in locating new employment. You will have a network of
friends to lean on. We want to grow as a community with you and your families.

Education is an important part of being a prepared organization.  Each monthly
meeting will include a discussion. This can be a talk on anything related to
freethought, science, religion, counter-apologetics, philosophy, or activism.
Members are encouraged to write and present a talk concerning any of these
subjects. Let us know if you are interested in doing so. We also plan on
bringing in guest speakers from time to time to share their knowledge with us.


Events are a great way to get to know each other, learn as a group, or just
have fun. Join us at our monthly meeting. Come hang out with us on LFS Pub
Nights. Families are welcome at picnics, play dates, pizza parties, bowling
nights, and more! We try to mix up the days of the week that events occur on in
order to give everyone the best chance to attend at least some of our events.


Activism is sometimes needed to defend the separation of church and state in
our area and nationwide, but picket lines are not the only form of activism.
Charity events to help our local community, litter pickups, and helping those
in need are also a form of activism. We are not haters in LFS but we will
defend our rights.


I look forward to meeting you and your families and to welcome you as part of
the LFS Family.

Scott Rhoades

President – Lancaster Freethought Society
