About Us and Our Values:

The Humanist Hub is a place where you can connect with other people, act to
make the world better, and evolve as a human being.

We are a center for humanist life — a nonreligious community committed to the
power of human connection to help us do good and live well. We use reason and
dialogue to determine our highest ethical values, we act on those values with
love and compassion, and we help one another evolve as individuals, as we work
to improve our world.

Founded in 1974 as the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard, we were a small
organization serving Humanists, atheists, and agnostics at and around Harvard
University for over 30 years. In recent years we have evolved into a hub for
secular community-building activities at Harvard, in Greater Boston, and
beyond.

All are welcome to join us every Sunday at 1:30pm! We also have many other
public programs and ways you can get involved, on other days of the week. 

We are located at 30 JFK Street (4th Floor) in Harvard Square.

Check out our website: humanisthub.org.

    Insecurity is underrated. In a society that values confidence and
    assertiveness, "insecure" is one of the worst, most damning insults with
    which to characterize a person... Learn more
