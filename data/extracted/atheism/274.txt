Navigator             Strong Atheism Explained

HOME                  Strong Atheism is the proposition that we should not
                      suspend judgment about the non-existence of a god or
INTRO                 gods. More extensively, it is a positive position against
                      theistic values, semantics and anti-materialism, a
FAQ                   rational inquiry in the nature of religious thought, a
                      new way of thinking about religious and spiritual issues.

                      What's obvious enough today is that despite fundamental
                      disagreements, common sceptics and theists have a certain
[banner]              number of things in common that would threaten to cast
                      constructive philosophy and science into minority
[sec_web]             support. This website, while host to many different
                      viewpoints, aims to provide a rational alternative to
[aa]                  such positions by making a case for what we can broadly
                      call "constructive naturalism", including metaphysical
[oa]                  realism, materialism, scientific inquiry, and moral
                      objectivity.
