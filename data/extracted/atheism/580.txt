We are deity-free parents who share in the daunting task of raising our
children free from religion in a community where religious upbringing is the
norm. Parents of children of all ages, including adult children and even
children-to-be, are encouraged to share their positive and not-so-positive
experiences in dealing with religion-free parenting, from coping with religious
extended family, to addressing religiously-inspired bullying in schools, to
handling the inevitable existential questions with honesty and clarity.

Through our support of each other and the building of our own community, we can
create a more positive atmosphere for ourselves and our families. To that end,
we will meet in person on a regular basis, but participation online in our
Facebook group is also strongly encouraged. Meetups will include
family-friendly gatherings as well as opportunities for parents to socialize in
an adults-only atmosphere. Group members with younger children are also welcome
to set up playdates with each other via this and our Facebook pages.

Tri-City Raising Freethinkers is part of the Mid-Columbia Coalition of Reason.
