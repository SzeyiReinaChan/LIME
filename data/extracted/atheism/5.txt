     I am taking the fight against honor violence to Capitol Hill. I need your
                                     support.
      Stand with me to end honor violence in the US. Please sign my petition.
    .
    .
    I will not accept little girls in the United States to be forced into
    marriage, or their genitals to be cut; for them to be pulled out of school,
    or for them to be condemned to a life of submission or violence or death
    through an honor killing. Silence is an accomplice to injustice. Speak out
    today.

    Honor violence
   
    Honor violence is typically seen in the form of physical or emotional
    abuse, sexual assault, rape or kidnapping - but it also includes female
    genital mutilation and forced marriage. In its most extreme cases, honor
    violence can lead to murder. In sharp contrast to other forms of domestic
    violence, honor violence is often condoned by families and communities,
    making it particularly difficult to identify and stop. It often involves
    several perpetrators within the family or community.

    Forced Marriage
   
    A forced marriage occurs when an individual is forced, coerced, threatened,
    or tricked to marry without her informed consent.

[GET INVOLVED]

AHA Foundation is a 501(c)3 non-profit founded by women’s rights activist Ayaan
Hirsi Ali. The AHA Foundation is the leading organization working to end honor
violence that shames, hurts or kills thousands of women and girls in the US
each year, and puts millions more at risk. The organization also works to
elevate the status of women and girls globally, so they can create peace and
prosperity for themselves, their communities and the world.

Why Support the AHA Foundation

The work of the AHA Foundation is more relevant and critical than ever. Global
events point to horrifying accounts of culturally-motivated abuse and murder of
women and girls around the world. In the US, the number of women and girls
suffering from honor violence, coercion and oppression is rising at an alarming
rate.




“I don’t see how anyone who believes in the rule of law and the rights of women
could do anything other than support efforts to end female-genital mutilation,
forced marriage and honor killings - practices that have no place in the 21st
century.”

        With girls at risk in Massachusetts, we felt it was key to have state
        legislation as one of the many tools needed to fight female genital
        mutilation. The AHA Foundation has been a significant resource and
        guide in helping us navigate the process.

        Not a day goes by that I am not grateful for the way the AHA Foundation
        helped one of my patients, a pregnant teenager at risk of honor
        violence. The AHA Foundation quickly stepped in to help my patient
        escape her dangerous home.

        A year ago, I reached out to the AHA Foundation for assistance. I
        wanted a better life for myself, and a bright future with endless
        possibiity. An end to the crippling of the culture I was born into.
        Today, I am living my dreams: a free human being who can choose her own
        lifestyle. Thank you.

        Thank you… I appreciate the help I have received and I am truly
        grateful that people like you exist and are willing to help a complete
        stranger. Maybe one day I can do something like this too!
