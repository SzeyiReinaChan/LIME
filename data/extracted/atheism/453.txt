If you suspect or are reasonably convinced that humans created "God" (and NOT
the other way around), then you have just found a starting point for meeting
new people who think and believe the same way as you. The objective of this
MeetUp Group is simply to bring Non-Theistic people together in a friendly, fun
and convenient location in the West Treasure Valley.

Ultimately, our hope is that you'll be able to meet other people who also share
your daily interests and important values...(minus the "faith factor"!)

Of course, our common group focus at the meetings will be centered around
Atheism/Agnosticism - Revelation based Religion and it's effects upon you,
society, and the world in which we all live - Personal Testimonies, Science vs
Religion, etc, etc....
All these issues are vitally important, but the most important component is;...
YOU!

So...Bring all of who you are to

THE WEST VALLEY FREETHINKERS MEET UP

We have every confidence that the fun, the new friendships and all of the rest
will "naturally" take care of itself.

Besides our meetings, WVFT also has an active community posting on our message
board, and our chatroom is also there for anyone who cares to pop in.
