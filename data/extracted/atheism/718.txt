Hispanic American Freethinkers The first secular Hispanic nonprofit in America

Founded initially in 2010 in the Washington, DC area to serve as a resource and
support to all Hispanic freethinkers in the country, it quickly grown to be the
premier Hispanic organization in support of critical thinking. HAFree
encourages everyone to find the difference between what is real and what is
imaginary through science, rational thought, skepticism, secular humanism,
logical and scientific criticism of all un-natural (i.e. supernatural,
paranormal) claims and dogmas, as well as rational evaluation of faith-based
myths. Through these tools and the idea that everyone should have absolute
freedom of conscience, HAFree seeks to be a voice for those who can’t speak for
themselves while also strongly promoting the Constitutional principle of state
and church separation.
