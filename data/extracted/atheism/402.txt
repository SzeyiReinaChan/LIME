Hello!  This is the public page for Contra Costa Atheists and Freethinkers 
(CCAF).  Most of our events are in the Walnut Creek and Pleasant Hill area of
Contra Costa County, California.

You may find our group interesting if you subscribe to the idea that knowledge
of reality advances by way of scientific inquiry.  We are particularly
skeptical about references to religious dogma or supernatural phenomena as a
useful explanation for anything (to say the least).

We especially encourage you to disclose your atheist, skeptical or freethinker
views as a method of educating the uninformed public about who we are — and
that we are many!

As we have learned from the LGBT community, an effective strategy for promoting
positive change is to come out, stay out, and speak out. The Openly Secular
campaign provides one way you can come out and tell your story:

CCAF endeavors to provide informative and enjoyable activities that promote
opportunities for faith-free discourse. Our activities have included
thought-provoking talks by invited speakers; discussions about various topics,
including videos and books; group rendezvous at clubs, movies and restaurants;
organized hikes and tours; and just getting to know and enjoy each other at
parties.  Suggestions for new activities are always welcome, and we encourage
member-initiated events.

If you want to join CCAF, you will need to be signed-up with Meetup.  However,
CCAF is a private organization, and requests to join will be reviewed.  In
part, this is to provide a measure of security to members who are not yet ready
to announce their views to casual online visitors. This is also to discourage
commercial solicitation or tacit endorsement of weird viewpoints.

If you want to join, please be prepared to provide an image with your request.
 While a photograph of yourself would be appreciated, you may use any legal
image or graphic that you like.  This removes the unsightly and distracting
question mark or blank square that would otherwise be attached to your name.

Also, please be prepared to answer a few simple questions.

Although CCAF is affiliated with other atheist and skeptic organizations, we do
not share our membership list.  Our general focus is to provide a safe local
community forum.  But we are also ready to inform and mobilize our members for
action if local issues directly impact the status of atheists and freethinkers.

A brief history:  Beginning in 2006, CCAF was originally known as Atheists and
Freethinkers of Contra Costa County. It was organized around an email list of
interested individuals.  In July 2011 CCAF migrated to the Meetup platform,
which provides useful membership and organizational tools.
