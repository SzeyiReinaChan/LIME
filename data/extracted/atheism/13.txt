For current and former religious professionals without supernatural beliefs.

Welcome to The Clergy Project

Are you a religious professional who no longer
holds to supernatural beliefs? 

Have you remained in vocational ministry,
secretly hiding away your non-belief?

Are you struggling over where to go from here
with your life and career?

  • Maybe you’ve been out for some time, out of the ministry and maybe even
    publicly out as a non-believer? 
  • Maybe you’ve found that the challenges continue to come with your new life
    and you’re in need of some good community with people who understand the
    issues you face? 
  • Maybe you’d simply love to connect with other religious professionals who
    have likewise left belief behind? 

If  this fits,  please join the The Clergy Project^® community!

TCP was established in 2011 to provide a safe haven of protected, anonymous
online community for former and active religious professionals who no longer
hold to supernatural beliefs.  

We invite you to join us!

which The Revenant won for best drama and Leonardo DiCaprio won for best actor.
The opinions expressed below still stand. Good thing for this movie that I’m
not on the nominating committee.
