                                              Thank you to PhACT president Bob
                                              Glickman and former president
                                              Eric Krieg for their work in
                                              obtaining the 501(c)3
                                              designation.

                                              Who asks questions like these?

                                              Does astrology work?

                                              What is therapeutic touch?

                                              Are UFOs alien spacecraft?

                                              Can we remember past lives?

                                              Can psychics foretell the future?

                                              What do near death experiences
                                              mean?

                                              Can hypnotism recover lost
                                              memories?

                                              What frequency are psychic
                                              vibrations?

                                              We do.

                                              We ask: What is the evidence?
                                              What can one reasonably deduce
                                              from that evidence? Do we need to
                                              suppose paranormal powers were
                                              involved? Could there be a
                                              simpler explanation? Could this
                                              have happened by chance? Can we
                                              do an experiment to test this?
                                              Whose story can we trust? Is this
                                              a hoax? What are the facts?

                                              We are the Philadelphia
                                              Association for Critical Thinking
                                              (PhACT). We love tough questions,
                                              but we maintain that there is
                                              only one way to find trustworthy
                                              answers: to use reason and to
                                              experiment. We reject wishful
                                              thinking, anecdotes, revelation,
                                              unsupported authority, and
                                              "everybody knows." We ask only,
                                              "What are the facts and what can
                                              we deduce from them?"

                                              Of course, we don't know all the
                                              answers; nobody does, whatever
                                              they may claim. There are many
                                              questions which cannot be
                                              answered now and some which may
                                              never be answered.

                                              Our difference?

                                              Critical thinkers don't invent
                                              answers when there are none. We
                                              are not afraid to admit we don't
                                              know. We would rather suspend
                                              judgment than mislead ourselves
                                              and others.

                                              PhACT encourages people to think
                                              critically about their beliefs
                                              and about the validity of the
                                              information presented to them.
                                              PhACT does not presume to tell
                                              people what to think but it does
                                              give guidance in how to think.
                                              Like Josh Billings, we believe
                                              that what hurts you more is not
                                              what you don't know but what you
                                              know that isn't so. We do not
                                              arbitrarily reject anything
                                              unexamined. Instead, we encourage
                                              the responsible scientific
                                              investigation of paranormal and
                                              fringe-science claims. Our aim is
                                              to promote scientific inquiry,
                                              media responsibility, critical
                                              thinking, and science education.

                                              To carry out these objectives,
                                              PhACT:
