Welcome to the Meetup for the Corridor Secularists - a meetup for those
individuals and families with a religion-free worldview in the Iowa City-Cedar
Rapids area.

Please feel free to join us at any of our events to meet members and other
local atheists and freethinkers in the Corridor area. All are welcome to come
and discuss atheist philosophies, the religious influence in America, or any
other topics of interest. The intent of this Meetup is to form a community of
atheists, agnostics, humanists, freethinkers, and other non-religious persons
or families within the Iowa City-Cedar Rapids Corridor. If you are searching
for just such a community or are interested in learning more about the views of
our members, join us at any of our Meetup events. We look forward to meeting
you!

After joining our group, be sure to also join the other Corridor secular group,
the Corridor A-Team (listed in the banner on the left side of the page).

Corridor Secularists was established with the help of the Iowa Secularists, a
statewide nonprofit organization committed to creating local communities of
religion-free Iowans, educating the public on living without religion, engaging
in positive secular activities, and keeping the Wall of Separation strong. If
you are interested in getting assistance to start a local group in your area,
please contact the Iowa Secularists at development@iowasecularists.org.
