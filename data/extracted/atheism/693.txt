The new study is based on data collected as part of the General Social Survey
by researchers at the National Opinion Research Center (NORC) at the University
of Chicago.

The researchers looked at data from 30 countries where surveys, taken at two or
more time points between 1991 and 2008, asked residents about their belief in
God. Participants answered three main "belief" questions, including their level
of belief (from strong to atheistic), their changing beliefs over their
lifetime and their attitude toward the notion that God is concerned with their
personal lives.
