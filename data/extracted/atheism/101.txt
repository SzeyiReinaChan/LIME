Welcome to Expelled Exposed

Welcome to Expelled Exposed, a detailed look at the Ben Stein movie Expelled:
No Intelligence Allowed. We'll show you why this movie is not a documentary at
all, but anti-science propaganda aimed at creating the appearance of
controversy where there is none.

To learn why the claims made in Expelled are false, find out The Truth behind
the Fiction. For information on the producers and their actions, go Behind the
Scenes. To learn more about evolution and intelligent design, or to see what
other people thought of Expelled, view our links to other online Resources. For
the results of the contest to refute claims by the film's spokesperson, see how
visitors to Expelled Exposed Set Ben Straight.
