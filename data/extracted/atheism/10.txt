The Morning Heresy  with Paul the Morning Heretic
January 22, 2016

The Morning Heresy is your daily digest of news and links relevant to the
secular and skeptic communities.      

Lots of talk about the big CFI/Dawkins Foundation merger! Kimberly Winston has
a big story at RNS that's running in lots of places, where it's called a "royal
wedding," which, you know, may be overstating it somewhat, but I get it.
Anyway, it's got positive reactions from Ryan Cragun and Todd Stiefel in there
too. Oh, and me. Whatever.

Hemant says, "It sounds like a win-win for both sides." JT says, "I could not
be happier about this." Dan Arel says, "Given that secularism is on the rise in
the U.S. I believe the merger can only bring more positive change."

The Morning Heresy  with Paul the Morning Heretic
January 21, 2016

The Morning Heresy is your daily digest of news and links relevant to the
secular and skeptic communities.      

So this is a big, big day for us. If you didn't already get the email or the
press release, let me be the first to tell you that CFI has merged with the
Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason & Science, and their executive director,
Robyn Blumner, is taking over for Ron Lindsay as CEO. Huge, right? Do you need
a moment? It's cool, it's cool, I get it. There's a lot to figure out and a lot
to do, but you can get more information in this handy-dandy F.A.Q. about the
merger, which talks about how it will all work, what role Prof. Dawkins will
play, and stuff like that.

January 20, 2016

The Morning Heresy is your daily digest of news and links relevant to the
secular and skeptic communities.      

Point of Inquiry this week has host Lindsay Beyerstein in conversation with Dr.
David Grimes, author of Every Third Woman in America: How Legal Abortion
Transformed Our Nation. 

At Skeptical Inquirer, Matan Shelomi shows how we humans share something in
common with produce at the grocery store: we may all be, in a way, GMOs...

We Should Brace for Change

The Morning Heresy  with Paul the Morning Heretic
January 19, 2016

The Morning Heresy is your daily digest of news and links relevant to the
secular and skeptic communities.      

Skeptical Inquirer's cover story about the dismantling of the Bermuda Triangle
mystery 40 years ago by Larry Kusche is now online, and it's good stuff. 

Alexander Stille at The New Yorker looks at the "what did he know and when did
he know it" question about Ratzinger and the sexual assault of children by
priests. Ratzinger does not come off well, but this is also of note:

    Though the sexual-abuse crisis reached its peak in the public sphere during
    Benedict XVI’s papacy, the single figure most responsible for ignoring this
    extraordinary accumulation of depravity is the sainted John Paul II.
