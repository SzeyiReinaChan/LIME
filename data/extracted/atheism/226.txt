About

Ceiling Cat is a photoshop meme based on a photograph of a cat peeking through
a hole in the ceiling of a room. Its online popularity eventually led to
several derivative characters, including his nemesis Basement Cat and Basement
Horse.

Origin

While the original photographer of the image is still unknown, several people
have claimed to know its origin. Encyclopedia Dramatica^[1] states that the cat
belongs to Wikipedia user Samguana^[2] but this claim has not been confirmed.
In May 2012, Something Awful poster Quarex claimed^[18] that they were friends
with the cat’s owner, posting a similar photo of the cat from a different
angle. The user also said the cat in the photo passed away in 2010.


                   [blank-b3f96f160b75b1b49b426754ba188fe8]


The photo that would go on to become the image macro has been online since as
early as June 1st, 2003 when it was submitted to FunnyJunk.^[3] The photo was
titled “Stalker Kitty” and did not receive any comments for four years.

                   [blank-b3f96f160b75b1b49b426754ba188fe8]


It was not paired with the phrase “Ceiling cat is watching you masturbate”
until 2006 at the earliest. The captioned image first spread via YTMND, with
the earliest site created on February 8th, 2006.^[4] Several other sites^[5]
were created that year, but there have been fewer instances of Ceiling Cat
appearing on YTMND for each subsequent year. Two days after the initial YTMND
was created, CeilingCat.com^[6] was created. Ceiling-cat.com^[7] was created
November 22nd, 2006, solely hosting the captioned image.

Spread

The photo evolved in to a popular Photoshop meme. Many variants of this image
appeared on 4chan’s /b/, or random board, using the “cat in a hole” exploitable
in a number of ways, including appearing as a god. Ceiling Cat was added to
Urban Dictionary^[8] on June 1st, 2006. This definition included the fact that
the cat was a deity^[9], alluding to the Catnarok mythology.

             ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


On January 24th, 2007, the original macro was posted on I Can Has Cheezburger.^
[10] Kongregate posted a Flash game called Ceiling Cat Invaders^[11], a
knockoff of Space Invaders, on July 13th, 2007. On March 13th, 2009, design
blog Tubbypaws^[16] shared a DIY papercraft Ceiling Cat. I Can Has Cheezburger^
[12] posted a profile of Ceiling Cat on February 3rd, 2011, highlighting some
of the more popular image macro derivatives.

Myths Surrounding Ceiling Cat

Building upon this theme of Ceiling Cat as God, the Ceiling Cat meme spawned a
few different pseudo-religious mythologies. In Catnarok^[13], Ceiling Cat is
going to be the cat that announces the coming of the fight between Longcat and
Tacgnol. collected together as “Catnarok.” In March 2009, the Daily Kos^[14]
posted an image series explaining this mythology behind Ceiling Cat.


             ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


The LOLCat Bible^[15] has determined that Ceiling Cat is the LOLCat equivalent
of God, with Basement Cat representing the devil. This mythology has no
correlation with Catnarok, as it is supposed to be a near-direct translation of
the bible in to LOLSpeak.

    “Oh hai. In teh beginnin Ceiling Cat maded teh skiez An da Urfs, but he did
    not eated dem. Da Urfs no had shapez An haded dark face, An Ceiling Cat
    rode invisible bike over teh waterz.”

The Truth

                   [blank-b3f96f160b75b1b49b426754ba188fe8]


On September 22nd, 2010, Redditor avapoet posted a thread^[17] to the Today I
Learned subreddit pointing out a section of the original photo where a skirting
board is visible, proving that the cat is really inside of a hole in a wall and
not actually a ceiling.

Search Interest

Search for ceiling cat began in February 2006, the same month the first YTMND
sites were created. Search peaked in April 2008. Similar with other cats from
its time, search has been on the decline.
