  • Join us!

Meet other local atheists, freethinkers and heathens. Gather to discuss beliefs
and philosophies, and make new friends. We gladly welcome humanists, agnostics,
or anyone else with a healthy dose of logic, skepticism, and critical thinking.
We look forward to lively and diverse discussions.

Whether you prefer socializing at a bar, meeting at a local restaurant,
or science-related events, you'll find a place where you fit in at the
Greensboro Atheist Organization. We welcome all non-believers within the Triad
area & beyond.

We're 304 Free Thinkers
