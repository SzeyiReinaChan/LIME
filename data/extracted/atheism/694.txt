On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt - Richard
Carrier

[On]
The assumption that Jesus existed as a historical person has occasionally been

Jesus.

How to Defend the Christian Faith: Advice from an Atheist - John W. Loftus

[How]

the Christian Faith is the first one written by an atheist for Christians. As a
former Christian defender who is now a leading atheist thinker, John Loftus
shows readers why Christian apologists have failed to reach the intelligent
nonbeliever and offers practical advice for Christians, whether they want to
better defend their faith against atheist arguments, or actively convert more
individuals to Christianity.

An Atheist's History of Belief: Understanding Our Most Extraordinary Invention
- Matthew Kneale

[An]
"It aims to tell you everything you've ever wondered about religion but never
dared to ask."
―The Guardian

What first prompted prehistoric man, sheltering in the shadows of deep caves,
to call upon the realm of the spirits? And why has belief thrived since,
shaping thousands of generations of shamans, pharaohs, Aztec priests and Mayan
rulers, Jews, Buddhists, Christians, Nazis, and Scientologists?

Evolving out of Eden: Christian Responses to Evolution - Robert M. Price, Edwin
A. Suominen

[Evolving]
We are first cousins to the chimpanzees, descendants not of any biblical Adam
but of lumbering hairy ancestors who were building fires and hand axes in
Africa hundreds of thousands of years ago. Accepting this has been especially
difficult for Christianity, because evolution challenges many foundational
doctrines.
