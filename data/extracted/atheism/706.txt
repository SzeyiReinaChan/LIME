Huge list of atheist agnostic skeptic humanist websites

From Atheism United
Jump to: navigation, search

Welcome to the most comprehensive list of websites related to atheism,
agnosticism, skepticism, humanism, non-belief, and any other godless word you
choose to use. Please help us by adding any atheist sites we’ve missed. You are
highly encouraged to create an account and list your site. Visit the home
category for this page: Atheist Websites.

Every person that links to this list will be helping these sites. Please link
to this list!

We "keep the links on a given page to a reasonable number." Please feel free to
post a paragraph about your group on the Atheist Organizations Descriptions
page. Do not post links to Social Networks on THIS page - post those instead to
Facebook Atheist Groups and G+ Atheist Groups and Twitter Atheists. This site
is designed to help prop up and honor those who have gone through the effort of
creating a website outside of the social networking realm. Our aim is to
increase the search success of atheist owned sites.

We have an International category, add any website from around the globe and we
will categorize it for you as we accumulate multiple sites from your country.
Atheist websites of Romania was the first International page made.

Check out the special mobile view by clicking the link at the very bottom of
the page. Mobile users automatically get the better view.

Rules and Tips

  • Yes of course we encourage you to put your non-believer site on this list
    of links! Add a friend's site too!
  • Use ctrl-f function to see if your site is already listed.
  • You can also view the source code of this page by right clicking and using
    ctrl-f to see if your site is listed in the code.
  • Atheist owned and maintained sites can be listed down to near obscurity.
  • If you think the admin has updated the site in the last year or two and you
    think it adds something to the conversation of who atheists are... then add
    it. This project will embrace the incredible diversity of viewpoints among
    the atheists in the world today.
  • NEW: A DESCRIPTIVE SENTENCE CAN BE ADDED TO EACH SITE. KEEP AS SHORT AS
    POSSIBLE.
  • A <br> tag is needed at the end of every line.
  • Edit the section instead of the entire article. Two people can edit two
    different sections within the same article and not overlap. Don't be scared
    of making small edits in sections to put one in at a time.
  • Many sites will fit more than one category. Put the site into the ONE
    category it most fits into... HOWEVER...
  • Many sites specialize in something but also have a community (message
    board). Since a goal is to foster community we want to highlight those
    sites and therefore will list them twice. In the communities section and in
    the section they fit most.
  • To avoid bias, please post in alphabetical order.
  • No Facebook, myspace, or other social network links on this page. This
    project is designed to boost the worth of sites that atheists bought and
    administer... no corporate e-sites. List Facebook Atheist Groups here, G+
    Atheist Groups here, and Twitter Atheists here, and Atheist youtube
    channels here.
  • .wordpress, .blogspot, .wikia, and other subdomains of corporate sites
    should be listed on Atheist Sites 2‎. The only exception is the list of
    local groups at the bottom of this page because uniting atheists is a top
    priority on this site.
