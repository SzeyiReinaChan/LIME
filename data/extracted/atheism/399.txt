                     “With respect to public acknowledgment of
                     religious belief, it is entirely clear from
                     our nation's historical practices that the

                     of polytheists and believers in unconcerned
                     deities, just as it permits the disregard
                     of devout atheists.”
                     - Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, 06/
                     2005

                     “...ideological rejection of God and an
                     atheism of indifference, oblivious to the
                     Creator and at risk of becoming equally
                     oblivious to human values, constitute some
                     of the chief obstacles to development
                     today. A humanism which excludes God is an
                     inhuman humanism.”
                     - Pope Benedict XVI, in his encyclical
                     "Caritas in Veritate" (Charity in Truth)

                     Pope Benedict XVI stated in May, 2007 that
                     the Church had not imposed itself on the
                     indigenous peoples of the Americas. He said
                     that the natives had welcomed the arrival
                     of European priests at the time of the
                     conquest as they were "silently longing"
                     for Christianity. [Right, and rape victims

                     - President Barack Obama, in his Inaugural
                     Address

                     “Democracy demands that the religiously
                     motivated translate their concerns into
                     universal, rather than religion-specific,
                     values. It requires that their proposals be
                     subject to argument, and amenable to
                     reason. I may be opposed to abortion for
                     religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a
                     law banning the practice, I cannot simply
                     point to the teachings of my church or
                     evoke God's will. I have to explain why
                     abortion violates some principle that is
                     accessible to people of all faiths,
                     including those with no faith at all.”
                     - Sen. Barack Obama, 6/28/06

                     “The separation of church and state is
                     critical and has caused our democracy and

                Why Join an Atheist Organization?

In a 1999 poll, 48% of Americans said they would not consider
voting for an atheist. Some dictionaries offer an alternate
definition of atheist as “wicked.” The Boy Scouts membership form
says, “no member can grow into the best kind of citizen without
recognizing his obligation to God.”

How are people supposed to know that atheists in fact do grow up
to be the best kinds of American citizens every day — if we
aren't visible? Atheists of Silicon Valley is reclaiming the
A-word in our community by encouraging local atheists to come out
of the closet and be open with friends, co-workers, neighbors and
family. We're standing up and speaking out. 14% of Americans and
19% of Californians identify themselves as some kind of
non-believer.  We may be a minority, but we're sizable and
growing.  According to the American Religious Identification
