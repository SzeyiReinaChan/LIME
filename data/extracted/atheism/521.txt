1) What we stand for:

    Equal rights for nonbelievers and believers

    We think everyone deserves the same rights and privileges regardless of
    whether or not they have religious beliefs

    Separation of government and religion

At present there is way too much religion in politics and government to the
detriment of both – we support their separation as prescribed in the US
Constitution

    A sharing of the tax burden by all

Tax exemptions and special privileges for religion cost US taxpayers as much as
$1 trillion per year. If everyone, including religious organizations, paid
their fair share, we individual taxpayers would save about $4000/year in income
taxes

2) What we do:

    We hold monthly meetings and lively discussions in our member’s homes and
    celebrate various secular "holi"-days (July 4th, winter, End-of-Year
    parties with other secular groups - New York City Atheists)

    We participate in annual meetings and conventions for various national
    atheist groups including American Atheists, Atheist Alliance International
    and the Freedom From Religion Foundation. We're helping to establish a
    network of support and contacts for non-believers in all 50 states and
    Canada.

    Activism – We engage in the public debate on religion and atheism in the
    media. We submit questionnaires and petitions to politicians to educate the
    public on views of the proper role of religion in government and to inform
    incumbents of the needs and contributions of nonbelievers. We take part in
    various Westchester county festivals to increase the public awareness of us
    and to answer any and all questions about nonbelief and our group's
    functions.

Meet other local atheists and freethinkers for conversation and friendship!
