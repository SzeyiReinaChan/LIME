Humanists of Idaho is a Chapter of the American Humanist Association, reaching
out to Humanists and like minded people in Idaho. We are headquartered in
Boise, meet every month at the Flick's Theater on Fulton St, and sponsor
numerous speakers, outreach programs, and community activities. We are also a
part of Secular Idaho, an umbrella group of local freethinkers including Boise
State Secular Student Alliance, Idaho Atheists, Boise Non-Theist and Humanist
Meetup, and BUUF Humanists. If you believe that science is the best tool for
solving human problems, doubt that anything supernatural has ever happened, and
that people don't need gods to be ethical and moral people/lead good, prductive
lives, then Humanists of Idaho just might be what you are looking for. Humanism
- Informed by science, inspired by art, and motivated by compassion. Natural
answers to natural questions.
