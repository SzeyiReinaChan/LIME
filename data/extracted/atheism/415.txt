            Welcome to San Francisco Atheists

            San Francisco Atheists provides friendship, education, and activism
            for hundreds of local atheists.
            We are officially affiliated with American Atheists, and closely
            connected to other groups in the Bay Area. While many of our
            members simply seek the fellowship of other atheists, some of our
SF Atheists members are leading activists.
