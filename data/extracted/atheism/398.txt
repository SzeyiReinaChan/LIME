                The Atheist Coalition of San Diego is a coalition of
                unbelievers, atheists, agnostics, rationalists, skeptics, and
                secular humanists.  Our goals include keeping a firm, tall, and
                wide wall separating church and state; promoting atheism as a
                worthwhile and wholesome point of view; promoting science
                literacy; and coordinating efforts with groups who have the
                same goals.
