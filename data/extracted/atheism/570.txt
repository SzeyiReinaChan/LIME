The Tidewater Atheists Group (TAG) was founded in March of 2004 and is
dedicated to serving the atheist community of the Tidewater Area of Virginia by
creating an environment for fellowship through social and community building
activities.  Our membership includes atheists, agnostics, Ethical Culturalists,
freethinkers, brights, humanists, naturalists, secularists, and our friends and
family.

For the privacy of our members, postings and meetup locations are not viewable
by non-members. Members must be 18+ years of age (accompanied minors may attend
some events), and in order to prevent spammers and religious proselytizers,
membership requires approval.
