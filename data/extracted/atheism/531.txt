Welcome to the Black Atheists of Philadelphia group!

This diverse group was created in order to encourage off-line social
experiences for black atheists, agnostics, freethinkers, non-theists, skeptics,
non-believers of
color and other minority groups within the atheist community. We also welcome
the support and membership of our allies within the secular community as well.

Our mission is to promote camaraderie and community service, address the
psychological grip of religiosity that has been passed down through the
indoctrination and enslavement of our ancestors; confront both educational and
socioeconomic challenges that pervade the inner city and to encourage
non-theists of diverse backgrounds to become both open and active within the
Greater Philadelphia area.



We're 179 Atheists
