             "Nothing about atheism prevents me from thinking about any idea. It is the very
                epitome of freethought. Atheism imposes no dogma and seeks no power over
                                                others."
                                           - George A. Ricker

                 Update 1/1/2010: George A. Ricker passed away on August 10, 2009. He is
                survived by his wife Judy, a daughter, a son, two stepdaughters and three
             grandsons. George was born May 26, 1941 and was 68 years old. This website will
             remain online indefinitely, as the content will be relevant for years to come,
              and shows the passion he had for a secular society. Here is a recent article
             George wrote about his lung problem and how he didn't fall back on religion or
                                a god in his time of need. My Left Lung.
