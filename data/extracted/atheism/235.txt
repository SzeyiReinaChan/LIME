Cool. I’m sure they have nothing better to than squelch someone’s free speech.

رَاجِعونَ‎)

“The phrase is recited by Muslims when a person experiences a tragedy in life”…

I’m sorry these cartoons cause you so much grief. Maybe you shouldn’t look at
them…

Anonymous asked: I am not here to call you things or be rude. Just think about
what you are doing. You will get nothing out of doing this other than making
yourself look dumb. Here's an idea, get out of your house, find a job, get
money, find a girlfriend and make some friends :) because sitting infront of a
computer and hating on a religion wont pay any of your bills or get you
anywhere in life. Worry about urself not others or their religion. Hopefully
you will find peace one day. Best of luck bro -muslim

This isn’t about me or the rest of us. It’s about the freedom to draw cartoons
without being afraid of getting killed over it. Everything you see here is is
submitted to this blog from others. All we do is post the relevant ones and
sometimes answer questions. But thanks for the kind wishes.
