                                              Preface

                  People have long been interested in the circumstances under which it is
          appropriate to believe.  Often, the source of this interest is the desire to
          believe something for which one has insufficient evidence.  Extensive excerpts
          of the following essays by William Kingdon Clifford and William James are often
          reprinted in anthologies.  This is sufficient proof of the enduring interest in
          this subject, and of the importance of these particular essays.  But since they
          are excerpts, and since Clifford s Lectures and Essays is no longer in print,
          there is a need for the present book.  Indeed, usually the excerpts from
          Clifford s essay come exclusively from part one of his three-part essay.  And
          James essay is usually reprinted without parts II, III, V, VI, and VII, with
          the other parts not reprinted in their entirety.  Following are  The Ethics of
          Belief and  The Will to Believe in their entirety, along with added explanatory
          notes.  Following these essays is  An Examination of  The Will to Believe.   
          It is not the first examination of that work;{1} however, it is, I believe, one
          that adds a unique contribution to the discussion.  The reader is advised to
          read the essays in the order presented here (which is the order in which they
          were written), as James essay is a response to Clifford s essay, as well as to
          ideas of a like nature; and my own essay is a response to James essay.
                  It is to be hoped that the present volume will be useful to anyone
          interested in the question of whether it is appropriate to have faith that is,
          believe in the absence of evidence.  Indeed, even if my own essay is not as
          useful as I believe it to be, the availability of Clifford s and James essays,
          reprinted in their entirety, in one convenient book, should prove worthwhile.

                                        of the printed book

                  The text of William Kingdon Clifford s  The Ethics of Belief is based
          upon the first edition of Lectures and Essays, Macmillan and Co., 1879, edited
          by Leslie Stephen and Frederick Pollock.  The text of William James  The Will
          to Believe is based upon the first edition of The Will to Believe and other
          essays in popular philosophy, Longmans, Green & Co., 1897.  In the essays by
          Clifford and James, the added footnotes are indicated by   AJB .  This is the
          first printing of  An Examination of  The Will to Believe,  which was
          originally written in 1994, and has been subsequently revised.

                                          at this website

                  The text of William Kingdon Clifford s  The Ethics of Belief is based
          upon the second edition of Lectures and Essays, Macmillan and Co., 1886, edited
          by Leslie Stephen and Frederick Pollock.  The text of William James  The Will
          to Believe is based upon the Dover reprint of The Will to Believe and other
          essays in popular philosophy, which is said to be  an unabridged and unaltered
          republication of the first edition printed by Longmans, Green & Co. in 1897, as
          I was unable to obtain an original when this was first put on the internet in
          1997.  My essay, however, has been updated.
