  • ScathingAtheist 153: Quranimaniacs Edition January 21, 2016
    In this week's episode, whoremongers will murder your wife, we learn that
    nine year old girls who prefer consensual should avoid living in Pakistan,
    and Eli and Lucinda join us to review everything about the Quran except the
    words.
  • ScathingAtheist 152: Fighting God Edition January 14, 2016
    In this week's episode, American Atheist President David Silverman joins us
    to talk about his new book Fighting God (spoiler: you don't use
    lightsabers), plus Pat Robertson and Rick Santorum being stupid.
  • ScathingAtheist 151: Illumi-Naughty Edition January 7, 2016
    In this week's episode we learn why the bible is lying from an expert on
    lying; a biblical scholar teaches us how the rib bone is connected to the
    dick bone; and we'll learn that you don't have to be religious to be full
    of shit.  But it helps.
