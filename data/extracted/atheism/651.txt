Sock drive and monetary donations to benefit those in need across the nation

MINNEAPOLIS, MINN. – December 23, 2015 –The Satanic Temple (TST) Minneapolis
Chapter announced today that it is partnering with Soles4Souls, a not for
profit global social enterprise, to collect new socks for the “Socks for Satan”
campaign designed to help those in need across the U.S. In effect through Feb.
14, 2015, The Satanic Temple Minneapolis Chapter is engaging local businesses
in hosting collection boxes onsite to encourage consumers to donate socks to
the cause. Additionally, monetary donations will be accepted to benefit the
philanthropic endeavors of Soles4Souls.
“Partnering with a non-profit who would distribute our donations without
religious or political dogma attached was very important to us,” said John
Wreisner, head of The Satanic Temple Minneapolis Chapter. “Soles4Souls has done
amazing work over the years, and their dedication to helping others falls
directly in line with our mission to encourage benevolence and empathy among
all people.”

“Socks are one of the most valuable items for homeless men and women at any
time of the year but especially as winter sets in,” said Buddy Teaster,
president and CEO, Soles4Souls. “This donation will make a real difference to
those on the streets or who are just having a difficult time. We might not
think much about them but these socks will mean a lot of happy people in the
coming months.”

Getting involved in the “Socks for Satan” campaign is easy:

as many pairs of new socks that you can. Local establishments already
