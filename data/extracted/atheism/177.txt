    4Homeopathy – The Homeopaths Strike Back

    Before you begin, if your irony meter is switched on, then to avoid damage,
    please turn it off now. For the Society of Homeopaths have today issued a
    press release condemning sceptics for their ‘half baked arguments and lack
    of understanding of research’. The homeopaths are very angry at Simon Singh
    again and his ‘traipsing around the media studios’ talking about how the
    government are to review if doctors will be allowed to prescribe homeopathy
    on the NHS. (For example, see here, here and here where you can see Simon
    debating with professional homeopath, the Medical Jester to the Court of
    Queen Elizabeth II, [read more...]
