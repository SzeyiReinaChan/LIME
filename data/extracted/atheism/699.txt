Openly Secular

Secular people – including atheists, freethinkers, agnostics, humanists and
nonreligious people – are everywhere. They are your friends, your neighbors,
your coworkers – even your loved ones. But they often can’t be open about who
they are.

Openly Secular is changing that. Our toolkits, resources, and videos help break
down barriers and help secular people live full, honest, and open lives. Tell
Your Story. Speak Your Truth. Together we can eliminate discrimination and
increase acceptance.

Get Involved

If you’re Openly Secular, you can help get our message out and truly make a
difference in our fight to end discrimination against secular people by telling
your story and encouraging others to do the same. Let the secular people in
your life know about the many ways they can get involved.

Sharing your story will help encourage other secular individuals to be open
about who they are. For those who cannot be Openly Secular, your story will
help show them that they are not alone, that there is a secular community out
there supporting them.
