  • Join us!

We are a coalition of groups and politically active citizens coming together to
create a watchdog and lobbying group for the state of Hawaii. We believe in
supporting Jefferson's "wall of separation" between church and state. Our
lawmakers should make decisions and policies based on logic, reason, and
science, regardless of religious ideology. No church or offshoot thereof (child
care, schools, etc.) may play by different, more lenient rules and laws than
their secular counterparts. If you want to see your government run without
religious interference, then you've come to the right place.

The main groups that comprise the SCH are:

The Hawaii Secular Society (HSS)

Hawaii Citizens for the Separation of State and Church (HCSSC)

We're 136 Secular Activists

Join us!
