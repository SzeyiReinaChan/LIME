We are devoted to maintaining a continuing dialog between all people who
believe in the basic goodness of human nature without supernaturalism.

21st Century Humanism fosters the preservation and growth of Humanism, freedom
of thought, freedom of expression, separation of church and state, and the
traditional Humanist values of reason, rationality, experience, and the
scientific method in a post 9/11 world by examining the real problems of
humanists, agnostics, atheists, relativists, freethinkers, rationalists,
skeptics, and others.

Participants are not asked to place themselves in any category, and all
statements made by them will be treated with strict confidentiality by other
participants.

We meet on the second Sunday of each month and attend occasional social events.
We neither charge dues nor make assessments.

Children of members and guests may use existing playground equipment or read
and color in an adjacent room if they are not disruptive. At present parents
must be present to supervise them.

The group adheres to the tenets of the Humanist Manifesto III (2000).
