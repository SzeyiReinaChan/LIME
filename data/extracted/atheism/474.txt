                        School Supply Drive 2015
                        
                        Announcing the Fourth Annual IAF School Supply Drive!!

                        It's back to school season again, and that means IAF
                        has a yet another great opportunity for some community
                        outreach. Over the next few weeks we will be collecting
                        school supplies for donation to children, teachers and
                        schools in need. We will be accepting donations at the
                        weekly meet up (every Sunday at the weekly meet up) and
                        at any other IAF event. The donation part of our drive
                        is scheduled to close Sunday, August 16th.

                        Every donation is greatly appreciated! We are
                        encouraging financial donations this year to help
                        ensure our schools are getting the supplies they need
                        most. Of course, we will still gladly accept supplies
                        like backpacks, pencils, notebooks, etc. You can also
                        find more detailed lists of supplies on any Des Moines
                        Public School website. 

                        Last year we calculated the average minimum cost of
                        school supplies for an elementary school student to be
                        around $85.00. This amount did not include the cost of
                        student lunches, or registration and text book fees.
                        Help us sponsor students this year with a donation of
                        supplies or funds. Consider it an investment in the
                        future of our society. !
