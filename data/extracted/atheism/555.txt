                  Who We Are

                  The Atheist Community of Austin is organized as a
                  nonprofit educational corporation to develop and
                  support the atheist community, to provide
                  opportunities for socializing and friendship, to
                  promote secular viewpoints, to encourage positive
                  atheist culture, to defend the first amendment
                  principle of state-church separation, to oppose
                  discrimination against atheists and to work with
                  other organizations in pursuit of common goals.

                  We define atheism as the lack of belief in gods.
                  This definition also encompasses what most people
                  call agnosticism.
