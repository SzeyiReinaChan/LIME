                                                      that provides a visual representation of the
                                                      range of belief and non-belief (page 25); and
                                                      a variation that provides a visual

                                                      men and fixed in time, act like a time

                                                      (page 77).
                                                        An introduction of the term "superlegal,"
                                                      to describe supernaturally justified illegal
                                                      acts such as the 9/11 attacks which make
                                                      religion especially dangerous (page 153).

                                                      and lethal weapons could lead to mass

                                                  ~ Tim Covell

                                                  A number of authors have noted that if some
                                                  physical parameters were slightly changed, the
                                                  universe could no longer support life, as we know
                                                  it. This implies that life depends sensitively on
                                                  the physics of our universe. Does this
                                                  "fine-tuning" of the universe also suggest that a
                                                  creator god intentionally calibrated the initial
                                                  conditions of the universe such that life on
                                                  earth and the evolution of humanity would
                                                  eventually emerge? Some influential scientists,
                                                  such as National Institutes of Health Director
                                                  Francis Collins, think so. Others go even
                                                  further, asserting that science "has found God."
                                                  In this in-depth, lucid discussion of this
                                                  fascinating and controversial topic, physicist
                                                  Victor J. Stenger looks at the same evidence and
                                                  comes to the opposite conclusion. He states at
                                                  the outset that as a physicist he will go
                                                  wherever the data takes him, even if it leads him
                                                  to God. But after many years of research in
                                                  particle physics and thinking about its
           [51d3K7Wos9L]                          implications, he finds that the observations of
                                                  science and our naked senses not only show no
                                                  evidence for God, they provide evidence beyond a
                                                  reasonable doubt that God does not exist.

                                                  Stenger argues that many of the claims by theists
                                                  are based on their misunderstanding of the
                                                  science. He looks at the specific parameters and
                                                  shows that plausible reasons can be found for the
                                                  values they have within the existing standard
                                                  models of physics and cosmology. These models are
                                                  introduced in detail so that the reader has the
                                                  background needed to understand the role of the
                                                  parameters claimed to be fine-tuned and judge the
                                                  veracity of the arguments.

                                                  He also discusses related issues such as whether
                                                  or not the universe had a beginning, what quantum
                                                  mechanics implies about the involvement of human
                                                  consciousness in affecting reality, and whether
                                                  evidence can be found in nature for a divine
                                                  plan.

             [519H76G1TJ]       Just six numbers govern the shape, size, and
                                texture of our universe. If their values were
                                only fractionally different, we would not
                                exist: nor, in many cases, would matter have
                                had
                                a chance to form. If the numbers that govern
                                our universe were elegant--1, say, or pi, or
                                the Golden Mean--we would simply shrug and say
                                that the universe was an elegant
                                mathematical puzzle. But the numbers Martin
                                Rees discusses are far from tidy.

                                Was the universe "tweaked" or is it one of many
                                universes, all run by slightly different,
                                but equally messy, rules?

                                [Free_download]During the first centuries A.D.
                                Christianity grew from humble origins to become
                                the official religion of the Roman Empire. The
                                   newly discovered Gospel of Judas gives a
                                  different view of the relationship between
                                Jesus and Judas, offering new insights into the
                                    disciple who betrayed Jesus. Unlike the
                                 accounts in the canonical Gospels of Matthew,
                                    Mark, Luke, and John, in which Judas is
                                  portrayed as a reviled traitor, this newly
                                 discovered Gospel portrays Judas as acting at
                                Jesus' request when he hands Jesus over to the
                                                 authorities.

                                With The Da Vinci Code, Dan Brown masterfully
                                concocts an intelligent and lucid thriller that
                                marries the gusto of an international murder
                                mystery with a collection of fascinating
                                esoterica culled from 2,000 years of Western
                                history.

                                A murder in the silent after-hour halls of the
                                Louvre museum reveals a sinister plot to
                                uncover a secret that has been protected by a
                                clandestine society since the days of Christ.

         [0740721909]      Synopsis          Scott Adam's BLOG about his book
         God's Debris
        by Scott Adams
                               Imagine that you meet a very old man who   you
            It's a            eventually realize   knows literally everything.
          Treasure...            Imagine that he explains for you the great
         ...and  it's         mysteries of life   quantum physics, evolution,
             FREE               God, gravity, light, psychic phenomenon, and
        [Free_download]       probability    in a way so simple, so novel, and
                             so compelling that it all fits together and makes
                             perfect sense. What does it feel like to suddenly
                               understand everything?  God's Debris isn t the
                             final answer to the Big Questions. But it might be
                               the most compelling vision of reality you will
                             ever read. The thought experiment is this:  Try to
                                 figure out what s wrong with the old man s
                             explanation of reality.  Share the book with your
                               smart friends for FREE, then discuss it later
                                         while enjoying a beverage.

                                Still, God's Debris is emphatically not for
                              everyone. Although there s no sex or violence, I
                               don t recommend it for readers under fourteen
                             unless a parent has screened it. And if you don t
                               like to have your perceptions challenged, this
                              book isn t for you. However, if you like a good
                               book-induced buzz now and then, I think you ll
                                      agree that the price was right.

            Zindler      Nothing is new or original in Christianity. That is
                         the important thesis demonstrated in Christianity
                         Before Christ. The least important features, as well
                         as the most important components, were all well
                         developed in cultures that flourished before the time
                         that Christ is alleged to have walked the parched
                         paths of Roman Palestine.

                         With a Foreword by Frank R. Zindler, the editor of
                         American Atheist press, the book has 12 major
                         chapters, plus Bibliography, Subject Index, and
                         numerous pen-and-ink illustrations.

                         unexpected result in a process for traveling back
                         several hours in time. The men initially use these
                         rewind sessions to succeed in the stock market. But a
                         dark consequence of their daily journeys eventually
                         complicates matters. If this sounds like a very
                         commercial, science fiction thriller, Primer is
                         anything but that. The film has a tantalizing,
                         sealed-in logic, akin to Memento, that forces viewers
                         to see the fantastic with a certain dispassion. One
                         may be tempted to sit through Primer again to more
                         fully understand its paradoxes and ethical quandaries.

                      Why the Religious Right Is Wrong:   About Separation of
                      Church & State
                      Robert Boston, Barry W. Lynn

                      A journalist's account of how the religious right is
                      using the political  arena to wage war against the
        [0879758341]  governing principle of separation of church and state to
                      promote their ultraconservative agenda. The dangers of
                      the Religious Right movement - Rob Boston presents an
                      intelligent, well written argument against the threat of
                      the Religious Right movement in America. He traces
                      church-state relations from several hundred years ago to
                      the present day and confronts the non-Separationists with
                      zeal and passion.
                      Who Wrote the New Testament? The Making of Christian
                      Myth,   by Burton L. Mack

                      "I am very selective about books I choose to buy and
                      display; I prefer  those that can really make a
                      difference or illustrate a method or a new perspective.
                      Mack's book does an excellent job of debunking and 
        [0060655186]  explaining the Christian myth and deserves widespread
                      reading. If superstition and myth can be recognized and
                      understood as such, society will be strengthened and
                      enriched. It is like the Emperor's New Clothes - someone
                      has pointed at the Emperor and written an accessible and
                      enlightening book on the subject."

                      "Over a period of nearly two millennia, the Christian
                      Church has oppressed and brutalized millions of
        [0964487349]  individuals. Meticulously researched and courageously
                      written, this book examines the Church's devastating
                      impact upon human freedom, dignity and spirituality."

                       "Great book, solid arguments, a challenge to believers.
                      Russell's easy-to-understand logic dominates the work,
                      presenting an almost watertight case against contemporary
                      mythology. Christians of the world beware: this book will
                      change your life forever."  

                      "You find as you look around the world that every single
                      bit of progress in humane feeling, every improvement in
                      the criminal law, every step toward the diminution of
                      war, every step toward better treatment of the colored
                      races, or every mitigation of slavery, every moral
                      progress that there has been in the world, has been
                      consistently opposed by the organized churches of the
                      world. I say quite deliberately that the Christian
                      religion, as organized in its churches, has been and
                      still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the

                       "The English speaking world rarely acknowledges the many
                      and varied gifts that 'disbelievers' have bestowed upon
        [511lIL9AH1L] humanity. Churchmen generally contend that great figures
                      in history, such as America's founders, were conventional
                      believers. But author James A. Haught demonstrates that
                      this just isn't true."

                      for the thesis that the New Testament writings form a
        [0812693345]  part of a developing legendary tradition concerning the
                      earthly life of Jesus. Wells engages incisively the works
                      of the most ardent critics of the mythicist view of
                      Jesus. . .his critical treatment is nothing less than
                      exemplary."

                      Kary B. Mullis: Dancing in the Mindfield

                      Kary Mullis won the Nobel Prize for his invention of the
                      polymerase chain reaction, a chemical procedure that
                      allows scientists to "see" the structures of the
                      molecules of genes. Mullis is no shy, socially inept
                      bench chemist, though; on the contrary, he has led as big
                      and full a life as possible, opening himself to
        [51K6WKXDQTL] experiences like hallucinogenic drugs, surfing, casually
                      handling dangerous chemicals, and taking shots at the
                      sacred cows of science. Dancing Naked in the Mind Field
                      is Mullis's own chronicle of his adventures, from wooing
                      countless women to possibly being abducted by aliens, and
                      it's a funny, shocking tale indeed. This man certainly
                      doesn't suffer from lack of self-esteem, and yet you
                      might want him along on a trip to the astral plane, say,
                      or a tour of the human genome. Mullis is a fascinating
                      character and his autobiography will put to rest forever
                      the stereotype of scientist as skeptical nerd.

        The Case Against Christianity,   by Michael Martin
        A logical examination of Christianity by a professional philosopher -
         "This book is logically thorough and destroys Christianity on all
        important evidential and rational grounds, although I doubt that any
        whose faith has been sufficient thus far will be led to de-convert. It
        will however expose them to the fact that they have no rational grounds
        for their belief."

        The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception,   by Michael Baigent-Richard Leigh
        "Through a careful study of the scrolls, historical analysis, and
        interviews with scholars, the authors establish a view of Christianity
        that challenges the Church's adamantly defended 'facts'. Investigates
        why the contents of the earliest biblical manuscripts, found forty
        years ago, are still being withheld from the general public and studies
        unpublished materials that provide some startling new views about the
        early Christians. Not for the theologically faint of heart."

        "Campbell is particularly good on the Scrolls' historical setting and
        builds up a convincing picture of the development of different strands
        of religious thought, belief and practice within second temple period
        Judaism. If you approach this book without prejudice, as Campbell does
        the available facts, you will come to understand the origins of modern
        Judaism and Christianity."

         

          The Psychological Origins of the Resurrection Myth,   by Jack A. Kent
        Reviewer: Edward Tuddenham from London October 29, 1999
        "Although Hugh Schoenfield's Passover plot went some way towards
        explaining the events of Ca. 30 CE and other authors have exposed the
        huge discrepancies of the gospel accounts there has always been
        something missing in these revisions; namely an explanation for the
        core experiences which led to belief in a physical resurrection of
        Jesus. Jack Kent's book triumphantly fills that gap by showing that the
        pattern and timing of those first Easter experiences exactly fits the
        pattern of modern day bereavement hallucinations. Did you know that 50%
        of the bereaved report some kind of hallucination of the lost loved
        one? Including all the types of 'appearance reported in the Gospels and
        Acts. Paul of Tarsus' Damascus road experience was a prototypical
        conversion reaction. So after 2000 years of an illusion we finally get
        the real answer. Well done Jack! "

        "This groundbreaking volume features revelatory material--available
        primarily for the first time. These 50 documents cast a startling light
        on events in Palestine at the dawn of Christianity, alluding not only
        to doctrines we now recognize as Christian, but also to the precursors

        Holy Blood, Holy Grail,   by Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln, Richard
        Leigh
         "A brilliant read, see how history was changed and manipulated by the
        church. See how a poor French monk thumbed his nose
        at the pope, and because he discovered the "real truth". The church was
        terrified of him. The more you read of this book the more
        you become disgusted of religion."

        The Messianic Legacy,   by Michael Baigent, Henry Lincoln, Richard
        Leigh
        "Don't read it if you have a weak stomach or your not able to think for
        yourself other than what the priesthood tells you. It's another
        eye-opener!!! The authors further dissect elements of the life and
        times of Jesus and go on to discuss the development of the
        schism between Jesus's followers lead by his family members and the
        group of so-called "christians" lead by Paul. The method
        of these historians is breathtaking in its scope and elegance."

        The Fallen Star or the History of a False Religion and a Dissertation
        on the Origin of Evil,   by E.L. Bulwer, Lord Brougham
         "The author has shown how easily religions' votaries were ensnared,
        deceived, and mentally bound in a labyrinth of falsehood and
        error. The history of the origin of one religion will, with slight
        alterations, serve to describe them all. Their claim to credence rests
        on the exhibition of miracles which are a violation of the laws of
        nature. If religions were founded on the demonstrated truths of
        science, there would be no mystery, no supernaturalism, no miracles, no
        skepticism, no false religion. We would have only verified
        truths and demonstrated facts for the basis of our belief."

        Pagan and Christian Creeds: Their Origin and Meaning,   by Edward
        Carpenter
        "A very level-headed approach, doesn't go after Christianity to attack
        it, merely compares and contrasts it with the Pagan world and explores 
        similarities and hidden meanings still present in the religion today. 
        Incredible implications."  

        Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: Women, Sexuality, and the Catholic
        Church,   by Uta Ranke-Heinemann
         "This scholarly but accessible book details the way in which a deep
        mistrust of pleasure, and therefore women, came to be a
        defining characteristic of the Christian church. Focusing particularly
        on Roman Catholicism, Ranke- Heinemann shows that
        marginalization of women and sexual repression are not inherent in
        Catholic belief, but have taken center stage over centuries of
        interpretation by celibate men."

        The Great Infidels,   by Robert Green Ingersoll
        "The master orator eloquently eulogizes a few of the world's greatest 
        freethinkers (Bruno, Voltaire, Paine, etc.). He boldly states what
        their honest and courageous minds endowed to humanity. He also
        dispenses with the clergy who so ravenously attack the character of
        these brilliant lovers of Liberty and Reason."

        Atheism: The Case Against God,   by George H. Smith

        "I find it hard to imagine that an open-minded theist could read this
        book without coming away with serious doubts about the validity of the
        concept of a god. While scholarly, it remains approachable in its
        disassembly of the validity of faith, revelation, and the standard
        attributes of supreme beings. A must for any infidel's bookshelf, and a
        great challenge to theists who are open-minded enough to read opposing
        viewpoints."  ."

        The Big Domino in the Sky and Other Atheistic Tales,   by Michael
        Martin
         "Incorporating material from his acclaimed technical works, Michael
        Martin demonstrates that well-reasoned skeptical positions don't need
        to be presented in dry, philosophical prose. Instead, this defense of
        atheism is written in the form of science fiction, historical fiction,
        and fantasy that will arouse, provoke, and inspire the reader. The
        stories reveal the fallacies of traditional arguments for the existence
        of God and the improbability of God's existence given the evil in the
        universe."  

        Atheism: A Philosophical Justification,   by Michael Martin
        "Thousands of philosophers--from the ancient Greeks to modern 
        thinkers--have defended atheism, but none more comprehensively than 
        Martin. . .  Atheists should read it to bolster their creed, and
        theists should read it to test their faith against the deadly force of
        Martin's attack."

        Asimov's Guide to the Bible: The Old and New Testaments/Two Volumes in
        One,   by Isaac Asimov
        "If you are really interested in a critical and accurate review of the
        most misused book in history, the bible, the work and writing of
        Asimov, in these volumes as well as in his other science materials is a
        must. If you fear a challenge or need the comfort of myth, legend and
        superstition, don't read this book, or Sagan, they may make you think."

        "As a former fundamentalist, I have worked over the past ten years with

        dysfunction and addiction. Although there are several other excellent
        resources on this topic, Winell's book is essential for understanding

        Losing Faith in Faith: From Preacher to Atheist,   by Dan Barker
        "About half of the book is Barker's story of his conversion and 
        deconversion. The other half are a collection of essays Barker has put
        together about biblical errancy, his TV appearances and debates, and

        Brian Strassburg (Illustrator)
         "Excellent non-pushy kid's introduction to skepticism. I read this
        book to my kids, ages 8 and 10, and they absolutely loved it. One took
        it to bed that night to re-read and the other took it to school the
        next day. I've never seen such a strong positive reaction to a book
        from them. Yes, it's simplistic, but it's a kid's book; it has to be.
        As a parent, what i liked the most about it is the gentle manner in
        which difficult questions are introduced. We had to pause many times
        for thoughtful discussion. Kudos to Mr. Barker for an excellent book
        encouraging children to question the world around them and to try to
        apply scientific methods to understand it."

        "The renowned lawyer Clarence Darrow (1857-1938) was also an
        impassioned defender of intellectual freedom, individual liberties, and
        social injustice. In these wide-ranging essays, Darrow attacks beliefs
        in the inerrancy of the Bible, the immortality of the soul, miracles,
        and heaven as being completely at odds with human experience and
        science."  

        God and Evil: An Introduction to the Issues,   by Michael Peterson 
         "This concise survey examines the problem of evil in the context of

        reconciling belief in a just and loving God with evil and suffering in
        the world."

        Theodore M. Drange
         "Drange's book, with more clarity and meticulous attention to detail
        than perhaps any other on the subject, demolishes traditional beliefs
        with two simple arguments. The existence of nonbelief (in God) and evil
        (premature death and suffering), as Drange persuasively demonstrates,
        may very well constitute an insurmountable challenge to theists,
        especially evangelical Christians."

        Divine Hiddeness and Human Reason (Cornell Studies in the Philosophy of
        Religion),  by J.L. Schellenberg
         "In this clearly written and tightly argued book, J. L. Schellenberg 
        addresses a fundamental yet neglected religious problem. If there is a
        God, he asks, why is his existence not more obvious? Traditionally,
        theists have claimed that God is hidden in order to account for the
        fact that the evidence of his existence is as weak as it is.
        Schellenberg maintains that, given the understanding of God's moral
        character to which theists are committed, this claim runs into serious 
        difficulty."

        insights that deep analysis of personally significant beliefs can
        reveal. You do not have to be an Atheist to enjoy this concise and fair
        set of arguments in defense of Atheism and of embracing religion as
        useful fiction."  

        The Godless Constitution: The Case Against Religious Correctness,  by
        Isaac Kramnick, R. Laurence Moore, Laurence Moore (Contributor)
        "Concise Defense of the Separation of Church and State - This book 
        examines American History to discover the original intent of the First 
        Amendment. America is not, nor has it ever been an instrument for 
        religion. It was purposely founded on secular ideals to avoid the 
        oppression which all to often plagued governments where church and
        state were not separated. The American form of government is founded on
        ideals which were formulated in the mind of man."

        Why the Religious Right Is Wrong About Separation of Church & State, 
        by Rob Boston, Robert Boston, Barry W. Lynn (Introduction)
        "A journalist's account of how the religious right is using the
        political arena to wage war against the governing principle of
        separation of church and state to promote their ultraconservative
        agenda. The dangers of the Religious Right movement - Rob Boston
        presents an intelligent, well written argument against the threat of
        the Religious Right movement in America. He traces church-state
        relations from several hundred years ago to the present day and
        confronts the non-seperationists with zeal and passion."  

        The Most Dangerous Man in America? Pat Robertson and the Rise of the
        Christian Coalition,   by Rob Boston, Robert Boston "Despite
        televangelist Pat Robertson's high ranking in the powerful Christian
        Coalition, many Americans are unaware of his extreme political views or
        his goals for the United States. This book examines the role Robertson
        plays in contemporary politics and his efforts to influence American
        society through his various political organizations, businesses, and
        broadcast empire."  

        Eternal Hostility: The Struggle Between Theocracy and Democracy,  by
        Frederick Clarkson "What is behind the violence against abortion
        clinics, attacks on gays and lesbians and the growing power of the
        religious right? Frederick Clarkson makes it clear that beyond the
        bombers and assassins who sometimes make news, is a growing, if not
        well understood, movement that encompasses Pat Robertson's Christian
        Coalition, the Unification Church of Sun Myung Moon and the Promise
        Keepers--the lead agency of the so-called Christian men's movement.  

        Not by Politics Alone: The Enduring Influence of the Christian Right,  
        by Sara Diamond "The Christian right is many things. Its a political
        coalition with strong ties to and influence on the Republican Party,
        but its also a subculture that provides, as she puts it, ``a safe haven
        when political success is not forthcoming. Through the media, church
        and community organizations, and other avenues, the right creates a
        strong ideology. The ideology propagates the notion that this is a
        persecuted group battling immoral enemies (e.g., abortion doctors, gay
        employees) in an eternal struggle between good and evil. In such a
        context, momentary political travails are of little consequence."

          Wrath of Angels: The American Abortion War,   by Jim Risen, Judy
        Thomas, James Risen
        "Wrath of Angels is hard-hitting, objective, scary. From governmental
        agencies more concerned about their egos than solving clinic bombings,
        to the terrorist praising God in prayer and song while driving from a
        clinic she just torched, it is not only scary; it is sickening. Whether
        Catholic or fundamentalist, from the left or the right, blockades or
        bombings or shootings, these are people who believe they have some
        message from God to deny women the ability to make personal, medical
        decisions about their reproductive lives. Each part of the story is
        told in a way that gives readers the opportunity to make up their own
        minds and judge for themselves the appropriateness of these actions."  

        The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements,   by Eric
        Hoffer
         "As we try to make sense of our world, it helps to explore the wisdom
        of people like Eric Hoffer. Known as the longshoreman philosopher,
        Hoffer had virtually no formal education, yet his awareness of the
        human condition was exceptional. In 1951 his first book, The True
        Believer was published. Subtitled Thoughts on the Nature of Mass
        Movements, it offers insights still helpful today. Here are just a few
        of Eric Hoffer's observations: 'The less justified a man is in claiming
        excellence for his own self, the more ready he is to claim all
        excellence for his nation, his religion, his race or his holy cause.' 
        'A man is likely to mind his own business when it is worth minding.
        When it is not, he takes his mind off his own meaningless affairs by
        minding other people's business.'"  

        Deceptions and Myths of the Bible,   by Lloyd M. Graham
        A "must read" for every seeker of the truth. Lloyd Graham, whoever he
        is, has made me a non-believer! After reading "The History of the
        World", I started seeking information of the historical validity of
        Christ, and have came to the conclusion, as Mr. Graham demonstrates,
        there just isn't any. I would like to see more from this author, but,
        there may be no need for it!"  

        [0879757361]Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion, and Morality,   by
        Steve Allen, Martin Gardner
         
         "This is an excellent layperson analysis of the Holy Bible. Steve
        Allen makes no pretension to biblical scholarship. Indeed, must one
        have such credentials to understand and appreciate the alleged word of
        God? I think not and neither does Allen as he rips through dozens of
        topics revealing the blatant flaws and fallacies of the "good book". He
        does stop to smell the proverbial flowers, which are the few and far
        between edifying passages. I must say that it is truly incredible that
        those of the Western culture either do not see or do not know how much
        of the Holy Bible is not well suited to children's bedtime stories." 

        More Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion, & Morality/Book II,   by Steve
        Allen "Steve Allen is the rarest of treasures-a comic genius and a
        deeply profound thinker. As Allen says in this book, and in its
        prequel, many of us have been guilty of reading the Bible for years
        without truly considering the impact of the moral values it expounds.
        Written in a "dictionary topical" style, most readers will not likely
        read it cover to cover in one sitting (though I did) . Those who take
        the time to read its contents, however, will be unable to avoid
        rethinking and reconsidering their long-held assumptions concerning the
        teachings of scripture and its impact on Western culture's view of
        morality."
