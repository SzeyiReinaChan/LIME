Greetings! This group is for atheists, etc. -- including agnostics, skeptics,
freethinkers, secular humanists, and other non-religious individuals -- who are
interested in meeting like-minded people and having engaging discussions. Most
of our events are in the northeast suburbs of Indianapolis (including
Noblesville, Fishers, Fortville and Castleton), but we also post events for
similar groups in the Indianapolis area, such as Indy Atheists and CFI Indiana.

Our bi-weekly Sunday meetup consists of casual, unstructured conversation. The
discussions often involve issues pertaining to religion and being
non-religious, but they aren’t limited to these topics. We also offer other
events, including focused discussions on specific topics, community service
opportunities, and purely social get-togethers.

We’re all excited to be a part of the fastest-growing religious group in the
nation: the non-religious. Our group’s main goal is to provide opportunities
for non-religious people to hang out with one another. We’re also interested in
increasing the visibility of non-theists in our area, and supporting one
another as we all face the challenges of being non-religious while living in a
community, a state, and a nation where religious organizations have a great
deal of influence on culture and politics.

Membership is free and open to all.  If you’ve just joined, feel free to post a
greeting, comment on a blog post, contribute to a message board discussion, or
come to one of our events.

If you’re interested in learning more about us, please explore the message
board (under the “Discussions” tab above), or visit our group blog.
