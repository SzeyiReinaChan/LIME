  • HALA meets Sunday, May 11, 2014: The Future of Humanism in Los Angeles

"Alone Together on Planet Earth"

The Humanist Association of Los Angeles serves Humanists and the public in the
Southern California area, holding educational meetings open to the public, and
discussing science, democracy, separation of church and state, and vital public
issues.

We usually hold one or more meetings each month, free and open to the public:

  • The HALA Westside Discussion group meets the Second Sunday of the month in
    Santa Monica.

Humanist groups also exist in Orange County, San Diego, Ventura County and
Santa Barbara. Our members also participate with CFIWest, Atheists United or
the Skeptics Society in Pasadena. See our list of Southern California
Freethought Groups.

We are a chapter of the American Humanist Association, the national
organization that has united Humanists since 1941, and the publisher of The
Humanist magazine.

For a few short statements about Humanism, see What is Humanism, Humanists on
Humanism, and Humanism, A Joyous Alternative to Religion on this site, and our
parent organization, the AHA.
