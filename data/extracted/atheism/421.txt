The Next Meeting of Humanists of Colorado

Sunday 17 January 2016 – Debate Watching Party

As luck would have it, a Democratic debate is scheduled for a channel received
over the air at the Secular Hub on a Sunday evening in the middle of January!
 So, our monthly HOC meeting will leverage this good luck.

We will meet at 6:00 PM at the Secular Hub on that Sunday, January 17th.
 Dinner will be provided by the HOC for members of the HOC (good time to pay
your dues if you have not done so in over a year).

Closer to 7:00 PM, other members of Secular groups will come to the Hub, and we
will join them in watching the Democratic debate on the big screen.  (The Hub
will also sponsor at least one viewing of a Republican debate, but that will
probably not coincide with an HOC event.)

This will be a ton of fun, don’t miss it!
