                                          Why am I calling the Bible trash? Because in spite of it being advertised as
                                          the "Good Book" and full of truth--- the bible is neither good, nor true.
                                          Believers don't read it with an honest objective mind, and refuse to
                                          acknowledge what I'm talking about. Somebody famous once said that the bible
                                          has almost as many mistakes as it has words. It is filled with thousands of
                                          errors, contradictions, and outright nonsense. Time and time again it has
                                          proven to be false. But religious people refuse to accept this, because it's
                                          not what they want. "The Truth" is that bible is ridiculous-- full of the most
                                          foolish absurdities. It has no place in the modern world. Keep reading, and
                                          I'll prove it to you.

                                          The bible promotes what is worst about humanity. God commands and rewards
                                          murder on the largest scale imaginable (innocent women, elderly, children and
                                          even babies). Moses and Joshua, following God's orders, slaughtered more people
                                          than Hitler. The God of the bible commands and rewards theft, lying, slavery,
