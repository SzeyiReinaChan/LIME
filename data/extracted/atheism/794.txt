AGM December 2015

At the 2015 AGM held on Wednesday the 16th of December, a new committee was
elected with just one change in personnel.

Jenny Howatson stepped down as secretary for family and work reasons. We thank
Jenny for all of her wonderful input through her time as secretary.

In her place, we welcome Caroline Wykamp. Caroline has a background in
management which will complement the skills set of the committee.

The newly elected Sydney Atheists committee for 2016 comprises:

President Steve Marton
Vice President Jessica Nissan
Secretary Caroline Wykamp
Treasurer Semi Ilhan
Public Relations Officer Thomas Kraemer
Assistant Treasurer / Secretary Mohamed Farahat
Public Officer Michael Beecham

Sydney Atheists look forward to another successful year in growing the
organisation, its members, funds and most importantly its impact on the wider
community.

One of our first assignments will be to address the Human Rights Commission's
Religious Freedom Roundtable for non-faith organisations in February. A letter
will be sent to Supporter / Financial members of Sydney Atheists by our Public
Relations Officer, Thomas Kraemer.

New Home

Sydney Atheists' previous venue has been closed for renovations and may no
longer be available to us in the format that we were used to.

We have a new and much better venue - the Function Room at Club Redfern. 
Located on the second floor at 159 Redfern Street (on the corner with Gibbons
Street), it is a 20 metre walk across Gibbons Street from Redfern station.

Not only is our new home very convenient to transport, we will have a far wider
selection of food, better lighting, more comfortable chairs, a huge screen for
audiovisual, a projector that screens from the ceiling, thus not interfering in
people's views. The location can be reached not only by stairs, but also by
escalator and elevator. Whilst one could not get a coffee or tea at our
previous venue, that becomes a possibility at the new one.

Attendees are well advised to get to the venue before our talks begin to have
their meals though on limited ocassions food may be brought into the Function
room. Drinks can always be brought into the Function room.
To see the menu selection, please go to  http://www.clubredfern.com.au/dining

A photo below shows the entrance to the venue under the SPAR sign.

Press Release

Dear Malcolm Turnbull,

Congratulations on your ascendancy in becoming Prime Minister.

We also congratulate you on your desire to advance the country and your
interest in science, technology and innovation. We would like to propose the
abolition of funding for School Chaplains.

As you are no doubt aware, chaplains and clergy in general spend an inordinate
time dwelling on and teaching ancient outdated texts to the detriment of
scientific knowledge and human advancement. It is our view that overtly or
covertly, they seek to inculcate religion - belief in imaginary beings,
imaginary places and imaginary afterlives - as well as backward thinking rather
than rational thinking, free expression and broad respect for the evolving laws
and peoples of the land.

Abolition of the Chaplaincy would save $250 million dollars and we see such
expenditure as inappropriate. We encourage you to do this.

Yours sincerely,

Steve Marton
President Sydney Atheists

Friday 11th September Talk - Exodus

[event_4379]

This is a special evening when two gentlemen, Nad - formerly a Coptic Christian
- and Mohamed  - formerly a Sunni Muslim - will discuss their journeys from
Egypt to Australia and from their religions to atheism. What was life like in
Egypt, what transformations occurred in Australia? What prompted them, how did
their journeys progress and what were the implications? How did their families
and friends react? Hear the answers to these questions and many more.

Dealing with Chaos - the mind's response to reality

In our Friday 14th of August Talk, Timothy Graham will discuss a range of
topics all related to the way the brain works in it's dealing with stimuli and
how we can tackle areas of epistemology. This will touch on areas such as the
evolution of the brain, how our brain processes information, optical illusions,
epistemological quandaries with respect to dealing with randomness and chance,
internal models of reality, truth and justification, the scientific method,
foundherentism, and obviously the flaws of using faith as a pathway to truth.

Please go to http://www.meetup.com/sydneyatheists/events/221807974/  for
details.
