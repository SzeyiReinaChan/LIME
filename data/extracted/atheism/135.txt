What’s A ‘Real Muslim’ Anyway?

January 23, 2016 Stephen Knight 2 comments

image

It’s clear to me that the problem of Islamic fundamentalism will not be solved
by non-Muslims. It’s going to take a great number of liberal, secular,
progressive Muslims to reform their own religion from within. That’s not to say
that non-Muslims do not have a valuable role to play in this process, but given
that this process has already begun, I think it’s worth asking whether we are
helping it or holding it back.

One of the biggest hurdles appears to be getting non-Muslims to accept that
there even is such a thing as a liberal, progressive, secular Muslim. Pointing
out examples invariably leads to cries of ‘no true Scotsmen’. How can they be
Muslims if they don’t wish to push their faith on society? Surely they are not
true Muslims if they favour secularism over theocracy.

I’ve noticed a double standard at work here when we consider the legitimacy of
progressive thinkers within the Islamic faith. Non-Muslims are quick to decry
Islamic fundamentalism on the one hand, yet hold all Muslims to a literal,
fundamentalist understanding of Islam on the other. Any deviation betrays a
lack of authenticity in the mind of the non-Muslim.

Sam Harris Predicted Donald Trump

January 21, 2016 Stephen Knight 4 comments

image

 

Ahead of Sam Harris’s scheduled talk in Australia, the organisers of the event
, ‘Think INC.’, shared the above meme on social media. Sam Harris is quoted
from his 2006 essay titled ‘The End Of Liberalism’:

    ‘Increasingly, Americans will come to believe that the only people
    hard-headed enough to fight the religious lunatics of the Muslim world are
    the religious lunatics of the West’

Rather than heed the warnings contained within, critics of Harris opted for
distortion instead – namely by spreading the lie that Harris was actually
issuing a call to embrace fascism rather than decrying the empowerment of it.
As Harris clarifies here:

    ‘The whole purpose of that essay (written in 2006) was to express my
    concern that the political correctness of the Left has made it taboo to
    even notice the menace of political Islam, leaving only right-wing fanatics
    to do the job. Such fanatics are, as I thought I made clear, the wrong
    people to do this, being nearly as bad as jihadists themselves. I was not
    praising fascists: I was arguing that liberal confusion and cowardice was
    empowering them.’

Fast forward nearly a decade and we appear to be catching a glimpse of what
liberal complacency looks like in the rise of one Donald Trump. A man who sees
the collective punishment of Muslims as a solution to Jihad, amongst other
abhorrent views. This man isn’t just some TV rent-a-mouth, but a Presidential
Candidate. If alarm bells weren’t ringing for liberals in 2006, they should be
now, because the house is on fire.

This is a perfect example of how toxic the ‘nothing to do with Islam’ brigade
has been on our political landscape. Whilst this collective can only insist
that we needn’t be concerned about Islam, the far-right are able to mine a
ceaseless supply of Islamic terror to bolster their narrative. The really bad
news is that this supply won’t be decreasing any time soon either.

What is on the decline however is the number of people willing to subscribe to
the head in the sand approach from the left – namely individuals who are able
to see, read or listen to what’s actually going on in the world.

Without a sensible, mainstream counter-narrative, who are the uninformed,
frustrated and fearful going to look to when those elected are clearly lying
(at least to themselves) about the problem? It’s no surprise that some people
may opt for Trump’s wrong ‘solutions’ over no clear solutions at all. Trump is
at least ‘in the right ball park’ as they say Stateside, insofar as the problem
is related to Islam. It’s just that he’s swinging like a lunatic and isn’t fit
to play the sport.

It’s hard to estimate just how many of Donald Trump’s supporters can be
explained by this phenomenon, but the answer surely has to be ‘more than
enough’. It’s unlikely that Donald Trump will ever make it as far as The White
House, happily. But it makes you wonder just how many warning shots liberals
are willing to ignore before they decide to reclaim the stage on this issue.
The consequences of my fellow liberals not being up to the task is a future
reality too grave to contemplate.

‘Block Donald Trump From UK Entry’ Petition

January 18, 2016 Stephen Knight 7 comments

image

Today, actual politicians in the actual House of Commons debated whether or not
Donald Trump should be denied entry to The United Kingdom. Some of them were
even being all earnest about it, throwing around words like ‘poisonous’ and
wagging their finger all assertively and the like. Straight face and
everything.

How did this happen you ask? Well, a while back the UK government decided it
would discuss propositions, suggestions or general complaints were they
presented in a petition containing 100,000 signatories or more.

One such petition titled ‘Block Donald J Trump from UK entry’  has amassed
575,655 signatures. The argument presented in the petition reads:

    The UK has banned entry to many individuals for hate speech. The same
    principles should apply to everyone who wishes to enter the UK.
    If the United Kingdom is to continue applying the ‘unacceptable behaviour’
    criteria to those who wish to enter its borders, it must be fairly applied
    to the rich as well as poor, and the weak as well as powerful.

Firstly, I’d like to thank the signatories for forcing me into a position where
I have to argue in Donald Trump’s corner, of all people. A man with utterly
obnoxious views, not to mention *insert obligatory hair joke before posting*.
Only in America could such a man be a contender for the top job, and yet he’s
somehow managed to make a bigger mockery out of the UK political system.

In a colossal failure of irony awareness, a significant portion of the British
public feel that the best way to deal with someone’s illiberal ideas is to have
them banned from our shores. What a beautiful display of hypocrisy. Perhaps
it’s all just a ‘bit of a laugh’. You know, that superior British sense of
humour that Americans just don’t get – or something. Well, this guffaw has now
mutated into a gigantic time and money wasting exercise. All the more
depressing when you consider the petition to tackle Female Genital Mutilation
in the UK only amassed 110,561 signatures. Granted, FGM isn’t nearly as funny.

Most importantly, many of my non-uk readers may not be aware that ‘Trump’ is
also British slang for ‘Fart’. If anything, I hope Trump is allowed to visit us
just for this reason. I for one, am greatly looking forward to the tabloid
punnery that will inevitably ensue. I can see it now – a gormless looking
Trump, snapped whilst navigating a blustery British landscape, that famous hair
all a drift– Headline: ‘A Trump In The Wind’. You can have that.

Common sense will likely prevail of course, and Trump will not be prevented
from travelling to the U.K. However, had Donald Trump just come to the UK as he
was planning (presumably), I imagine he would have left at some point yet
remained what he largely is: a joke.

Unfortunately, thanks to this petition, we, the U.K are a joke too. We’ve let
the world know we can’t take an opposing view, however risible. We’re sending a
clear message that we think freedom of speech literally is ‘up for debate’.
We’ve also played right into Trump’s hands. He now has the attention of our
entire nation – without even stepping foot here. Donald Trump should (and
definitely could) pay each and every one of those signatories for the media
exposure they’ve gifted him.

‘Reza Aslan Cannot Be Trusted’ Video

January 12, 2016 Stephen Knight Leave a comment

image

I thought it would be worthwhile drawing your attention to a video exposé on
our favourite Islamic apologist and ‘scholar’ Reza Aslan.

For those already familiar with Aslan’s particular brand of obfuscation, you
will find no new revelations here. However, it’s useful to have them all in one
place and presented in a coherent form for the benefit of those who have no
idea what Aslan is about. The video covers Aslan’s dubious credentials, his
false claims about FGM and his attempts to pull the wool over our eyes on the
issue of slavery within Islam. In the wake of any Islamist terror attack on
Western soil, I notice an increase in people sharing Aslan’s TV appearances on
social networks in order to bolster the harmful ‘nothing to do with Islam’
narrative. Feel free to send this video the way of those you catch doing this.

helps clear up some of the smears and myths surrounding Charlie Hebdo and we
talk about ‘that’ Sky News interview. In addition, we discuss secularism, the
far right and hate speech laws in France. #JeSuisCharlie
