The Detroit Grassroots Atheism Project (DGAP) has the primary goal of raising
awareness about atheism and atheists through direct interaction with the public
that we call "street teaching".

Project volunteers provide literature and a point of contact between the public
and the atheist community.

Through this interaction we clear up the common and uncommon misunderstandings
about atheism and inform people about what is atheism.
