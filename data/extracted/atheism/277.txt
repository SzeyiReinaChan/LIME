Atheism is the acceptance that there is no credible scientific or factually
reliable evidence for the existence of a god, gods or the supernatural.

LATEST NEWS: An Evening with Sam Harris


[SHFacebook]

The Atheist Foundation of Australia is proud to support Think Inc’s An Evening
with Sam Harris Tour.

In the current social and intellectual landscape, Sam Harris is a valuable and
vigorous agent of rational thought, where evidence thrives and evangelicalism
dies. A neuroscientist, author, philosopher and critic of religion, Harris
spearheads the New Atheism movement.

Alongside Richard Dawkins, Daniel Dennett and the late Christopher Hitchens,
Harris is one of the ‘four horsemen of the non-apocalypse’, dedicated to
expelling from society the detriments of religious faith, and promoting the
prosperities of science and secularism.

Harris has penned numerous bestselling and award-winning books detailing the
detriments of religious indoctrination, whilst providing critical tools to
self-fulfillment which fit within the modern social, secular and intellectual
landscape: The End of Faith: Religion, Terror and the Future of Reason (2005),
Letter to a Christian Nation (2006), The Moral Landscape: How Science Can
Determine Human Values (2010), and most recently Waking Up: a Guide to
Spirituality Without Religion (2014). His upcoming book is Islam and the Future
of Tolerance: A Dialogue, co-written with Maajid Nawaz (author of Radical: My
Journey out of Islamist Extremism (2012)), slated for release in October 2015.

Full members of the AFA will be able to purchase tickets at a 10% discount; an
email will be shortly sent to members advising them of the promotion code
required to obtain the discount.
