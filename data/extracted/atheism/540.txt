The Humanists of Rhode Island (HRI) is committed to volunteer service and
political activism for social justice. Our values are rooted in reason,
compassion, optimism and action.

We are an active group always looking for new ideas and new members.

HRI is a member of the Rhode Island Reproductive Justice Coalition and an award
winning member of Volunteers Beyond Belief. We are a charter member of the
American Humanist Association and have worked with many other national, secular
organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United
for the Separation of Church and State and the Freedom from Religion
Foundation.

HRI is proud of our longstanding monthly commitment to Habitat for Humanity,
and our four times a year commitment to our Highway Cleanup. In addition, we
participate annually in a walk for a cure for leukemia, raise money for victims
of domestic violence and most recently, Syrian refugee relief. We are beginning
a relationship with Amnesty International.

Our commitment to secular government and the separation of church and state has
made headlines. We successfully petitioned the City of Providence to remove a
cross from a public median strip and have placed a seasonal banner celebrating
the birth of our state's founder, Roger Williams, in the RI State House during
the holiday season. We make frequent trips to the State House to testify on
bills important to the progressive, secular community.

Help us change the the world and summon a better future for everyone.
