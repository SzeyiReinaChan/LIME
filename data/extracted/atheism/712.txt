June 4, 2016 – The Reason Rally!

In 2012, people from all across America assembled together on the National Mall
in D.C. for an epic event in the history of our country.  Standing in the rain,
we declared to the world, “We are many! We are strong! We are united! And we
are here!” Four years have passed, and we’re ready to do it again!

We’re converging on Washington D.C. once again, this time at the Lincoln
Memorial. In this historic place, we proclaim our dream of a future where
people are free to express rational and reasonable views without the fear of
reprisal, retaliation, or retribution!

The Reason Rally itself is a day-long event on June 4, 2016. We will also have
a variety of extra events over several days from Thursday, June 2nd through
Sunday, June 5th.
