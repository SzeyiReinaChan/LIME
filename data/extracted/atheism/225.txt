Chapter: 3: "Sounds Sciencey" (2015)

This one is dedicated to Susan Gerbic and her team of wikipedia editors,
fighting the good fight against facts claimed without references.

As I often say during Facebook arguments: link, or it didn’t happen.

But it has to be true, it says so on their wikipedia page.
SUSAN
Ugh, hold on.
WYLONA
Wait, 'citation needed?' They're popping up everywhere! You mean that somebody
just made up all that stuff about them?
SUSAN
My job here is done.

New Science Podcast!

on January 13, 2016
Posted In: Podcast

At the heart of Carbon Dating was the idea of using humor to promote science.
After meeting some fantastic science comedians, Festival of the Spoken Nerd,
I’ve been working to import a science comedy program to the US – and we’re
calling it The Peer Revue!

FirstNight

The idea is to teach scientists a crash-course in stand-up comedy, then throw
them on stage to perform a 5-10 minute set about their backgrounds. We recorded
their performances, and you’ll be able to listen to them soon on the Peer Revue
Podcast. Here’s a short trailer:

I’m really excited about the project, and hope you are too!

PS – some comics coming soon! Just for fun.
