This group is inclusive of anyone who shares the beliefs of Humanism or
Freethought.  Freethought is a philosophical viewpoint that holds that opinions
should be formed on the basis of science, logic, and reason, and should not be
influenced by authority, tradition, or any dogma.  Humanism believes in the
primacy of human, rather than divine or supernatual matters.

We hold a variety of meetups including coffee-shop social chats, book studies,
lectures, movie viewing, invited speakers, good beer, pretty much anything our
members are inclined to do to that involves a bit of organization.  Want to go
on a hike?  Announce it and people will join up!

Enjoy a break from the pervasive religiosity of the area with like-minded
friends (and new friends!) who don't mind that you don't "believe".  Our
members include ex-Fundies, seekers, not-sures and don't-cares; activists, deep
thinkers, and deep drinkers.  Musicians, electricians, retirees and students. 
Come on out and see who you can share your story with!

For family activities, check out https://www.facebook.com/groups/
758095587586187/   or PH Family Friendly Events.

We have also added a sub-group to PH it is the PH Atheists which can be found
on FB at https://www.facebook.com/groups/PHAtheists/...;


For a broader range of events, see the calendar at  http://
