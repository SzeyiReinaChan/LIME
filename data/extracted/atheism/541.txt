We're a fun, growing group that likes stimulating conversations about topics of
interest to freethinkers; such as philosophy, politics, and science. We also
like bowling, ice cream, and movies; not necessarily in that order. :) We
welcome new members and always enjoy seeing new faces! If you want to spend
time with new friends who don't think there's anything wrong with you if you
dont have a strong belief in the supernatural, this is the Meetup for you.
