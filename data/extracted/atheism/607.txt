Events

The biggest event of the year is the Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural
Humanism. We also have an annual debate with Harvard College Faith and Action
in the fall, organize Atheist Coming Out Week in the spring and host many other
talks, service events, parties and outings throughout the year.

Outreach

In addition to fostering a community for students on campus, we have
cosponsored several interfaith service projects and look forward to expanding
our community service offerings this year.
