Atheism

Various atheism-related writings.


Really good stuff

  • The Tale of the Twelve Officers
    Mark I. Vuletic's brilliant parable about the problem of evil. Everybody
    should read it.

  • Theist quotes
    Bizarre quotes from theists.

  • Atheist quotes
    My favorites from alt.atheism's Atheist Quote of the Month

  • Atheist arguments
    Some of the best postings from atheist newsgroups

  • Atheist humor
    Fun (and often informative) postings from atheist newsgroups

  • The Emptiness of Theology, Snake Oil and Holy Water, The "know-nothings",
    the "know-alls", and the "no-contests"
    A few rants about science vs religion, by Richard Dawkins.



Non-essential but good things

  • A Look into the World of the Gospels
    "There is abundant evidence that these were times replete with kooks and
    quacks of all varieties, from sincere lunatics to ingenious frauds, even
    innocent men mistaken for divine, and there was no end to the fools and
    loons who would follow and praise them."

  • The God simulator
    Your chance to be God.

  • Ebon Musings: Atheism
    This site contains several good essays about atheism (although I don't
    agree with everything he says).

  • Why won't God heal amputees?
    A site dedicated to the question of why God only seems to answer
    health-related prayers in those cases where the results can be explained
    away.

  • The Pagan Prattle
    Weird fundamentalist-related news

  • Was Hitler Anti-Christian?
    While Hitler often emphasized his Christianity in public, he is also quoted
    as having been anti-Christian in private — but on a closer reading, those
    quotes seem to be fabrications.

  • Common arguments for God's existence
    As paraphrased by atheists



A Christian site, for good measure

  • Answered Objections to Christianity
    Because you should never listen to just one side of the story.



And, you know, maybe we should all try to get along

  • The God Fuse
    "Ten Things Christians and Atheists Can - and Must - Agree On"
