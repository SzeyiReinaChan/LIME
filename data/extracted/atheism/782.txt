                      The Inland Northwest Freethought Society (INFS) is a coalition of freethinkers,
                      non-theists, atheists, agnostics, rationalists, skeptics, secular humanists,
                      unbelievers and anyone else with a similar mindset, regardless of label.
                      Originally founded in 1992, INFS has grown from a membership of 6 to over 100,
                      with well over 300 people on our "like-minded" mailing list. INFS is a regional
                      chapter/affiliate of the national Freedom From Religion Foundation (FFRF).

                      Our Group's Mission

                      We strive to support and inform each other to become more comfortable,
                      confident, and articulate freethinkers, non-theists, and atheists.  We strive
                      to make a difference by educating ourselves, reaching out to other individuals
                      and organizations who think like we do, and taking our message to the public in
                      issues of intellectual and social importance.
