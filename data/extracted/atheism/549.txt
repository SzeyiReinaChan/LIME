Black Hills Freethinkers is a group of atheists, agnostics, skeptics, and
anyone who considers themselves a Freethinker from the local Black Hills area.
We get together every other week for casual meetings to discuss current events,
life events, bad horror movies and anything else that comes up. During the
first meeting of each month we discuss business such as plans for the group and
our involvement in the community, these meetings are followed typically by
drinks and socializing after.

The best way to interact with us outside of our meetings is our public Facebook
page found at:

https://www.facebook.com/BlackHillsFreethinkers

 We also have a private group where you can talk more openly without fearing
that family or friends will see it, for more information contact us by using
the "Message" button on our public page, or else send us an email at
blackhillsft@gmail.com.

If you are just beginning to question your faith, or you have been a
Freethinker your whole life, you will find friends and a community with us. 
After all, like everyone else, we benefit from a supportive community for
friendship, learning, social service, and activism.

We seek to promote critical thinking, education, and science in our own lives
as well as our community and country as a whole.  We promote engaging in civil
discussions with people of all faiths and backgrounds to help our communities
come to understand the secular positions that many of our members support.


After joining please read our new member information in the discussions forum.

We're 266 Freethinkers
