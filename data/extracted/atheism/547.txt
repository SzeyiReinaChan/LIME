This group was started so that the atheists in the upstate could give back to
the community. We have been able to make and distribute over 300 care packages
for the homeless, sponsor 16 foster children for the holidays, buy over 400
teddy bears to send to children in the healthcare system, and volunteer with
many local organizations.

We have also adopted a highway in both Spartanburg and Greenville counties.
This is not only a great group for giving back to the community, but it also
makes it easier for like-minded people to meet and socialize. This group is
open to all atheists, agnostics, humanists, etc.

We're 285 Members
