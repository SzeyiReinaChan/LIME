Skepticism Conventions Guide

@Tim Farley @Skeptic Conventions @Leon Korteweg @Nathan Miller @Lei Pinter and
2 others

Skeptics gather to discuss critical thinking, irrationality, science,
pseudo-science and the paranormal and their effect on society. This guide lists
conferences, unconferences, symposia, workshops and other multiple speaker
events that cover skeptical topics in whole or in part.

In the US many of these events are sponsored or co-sponsored by the James Randi
Educational Foundation (JREF), the Center for Inquiry / Committee for Skeptical
Inquiry (CFI/CSI), Secular Student Alliance (SSA) or Skeptics Society / Skeptic
Magazine. In Europe many are sponsored or co-sponsored by ECSO, the European
Council of Skeptic Organizations or one of its member organizations.
