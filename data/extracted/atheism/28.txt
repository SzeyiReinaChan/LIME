Welcome!

Nontheistfriends.org presents the work of Friends (Quakers) who are more
concerned with the natural than the supernatural. Some of us understand “God”
as a symbol of human values and some of us avoid the concept while accepting it
as significant to others. We differ greatly in our religious experience and in
the meaning we give religious terms.

We are not a pressure group trying to move Quakerism toward nontheism. We bless
what our theist brothers and sisters bring to Quaker meetings and worship. All
Friends have much to learn from each other. We hope to strengthen the Quaker
tradition of welcoming people of diverse religious experience and to show by
example that this can include nontheists.

We are part of meeting communities that include theists and nontheists.
Together we worship and love and cooperate, even as we differ on the
particulars of our religious experience. Quakerism has been changing ever since
George Fox had his first opening on Pendle Hill, becoming deeper and richer. We
are all part of this living faith.

On this website we seek to explore our own perspectives and to reflect on the
meaning and implications of nontheism in the context of Quakerism. This is also
a place where theist Friends may come to understand us better and to join in a
deeper conversation. Please submit writings for posting. We also hope you will
use the “comments” link at the end of each article to express your views.
