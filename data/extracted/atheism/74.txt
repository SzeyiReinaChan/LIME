You are an atheist!

   By visiting this Web site you have announced to the world that you are an
atheist! This announcement is permanent and irrevocable -- our automated system
   has already sent notification of your godlessness to both the Library of
Congress and your mother. We will mention you to the Pope the next time we see
                                     him.

 Remember: as a moral atheist, you are bound by the list of Atheistic Rights &
                               Responsibilities.
