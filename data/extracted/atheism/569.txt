RRNA is a social and discussion group serving people who hold naturalistic
worldviews. Many secular humanists, atheists, freethinkers, skeptics, and
Buddhists are naturalistic. The "brights" movement, from which this group grew,
advocated a naturalistic worldview. "Naturalism," as we use it, comes from the
field of philosophy. But one needn't be versed in philosophy to know one is a
naturalist; many people live with a naturalistic assumption, but would not be
familiar with the label.  Simply put, naturalism asserts that nothing
supernatural exists. Most naturalists would agree, for example, that everything
is physical. And nearly all naturalists see science as the best guide to
evaluating the characteristics of what there is.

We invite those who have, or are considering, naturalistic perspectives.
