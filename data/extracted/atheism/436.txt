                                                   We stand at the cusp of a new way of thinking about and understanding our
                                                   world; one which is not bound to the traditions of prosaic beliefs and
                                                   archaic institutions. American Humanism is a consistent advocate for a
                                                   naturalistic approach to the problems of human life.
