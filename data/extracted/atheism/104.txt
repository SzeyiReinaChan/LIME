How does it work?

rbutr is a community-driven app which connects webpages together on the basis
that one page argues against the other.

  • Visit a rbutd page and you will be told "There are rbutls to this page."
    You can then open up the rebutting article(s).
  • Found a great rbutl? Connect it to the page(s) it rebuts so that people
    reading those articles can know about it.
  • Want a rbutl for a page you have found? Submit a request to the community.
