Announcement

The good folks over at http://reasonistink.com contacted yours truly about
doing a tee shirt. I did a shirt a few years back and it was a disaster, so
here’s hoping this does a little better. If any of you fans have ideas for
designs, I’d love to hear/see them.

Silencing the criticsGreetings fans,As a creator of high quality entertainment
such as The Atheist Pig, I do have my fair share of critics.I know, it’s hard
to believe, but it’s true.Perhaps the most popular criticism I receive is that
I ripped off Dave Sim’s Cerebus the Aardvark character when creating Winston.
While I do admit that I did read a few of Sim’s comics back in the day, I was
in no way a big fan. Not to take anything away from Dave, I just wasn’t that
interested.However, the criticism remains, which has prompted me to create a
comparison between the two characters.On the left is Cerebus as drawn by Dave
Sim. On the right is Winston as drawn by me. As you can clearly see, there is
absolutely no similarity between the two characters whatsoever. The color is
even different, for crying out loud.

Silencing the critics

Greetings fans,

As a creator of high quality entertainment such as The Atheist Pig, I do have
my fair share of critics.

I know, it’s hard to believe, but it’s true.

Perhaps the most popular criticism I receive is that I ripped off Dave Sim’s
Cerebus the Aardvark character when creating Winston. While I do admit that I
did read a few of Sim’s comics back in the day, I was in no way a big fan. Not
to take anything away from Dave, I just wasn’t that interested.

However, the criticism remains, which has prompted me to create a comparison
between the two characters.

On the left is Cerebus as drawn by Dave Sim. On the right is Winston as drawn
by me. As you can clearly see, there is absolutely no similarity between the
two characters whatsoever. The color is even different, for crying out loud.
