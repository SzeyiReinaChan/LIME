Founded in Amsterdam in 1952, our vision is a Humanist world; a world in which
human rights are respected and everyone is able to live a life of dignity. We
work to build and represent the global Humanist movement that defends human
rights and promotes Humanist values world-wide.

  • Read more about our strategy and the Humanist worldview.

Headquartered in London, United Kingdom, IHEU is an international
non-governmental organisation (NGO) with representation on various United
Nations committees and other international bodies. We seek to influence
international policy through representation and information, to build the
humanist network, and let the world know about the worldview of Humanism.
