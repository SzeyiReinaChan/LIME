further than atheism titleWelcome to Further Than Atheism. Written for
non-believersof all stripes, Further Than Atheism is an ongoing attempt to
explore the territory that lies beyond the rejection of gods that all atheists
share. It is based upon the insight that atheism should be a beginning, not an
end in itself. By focusing merely upon what they do not believe, atheists
restrict themselves to mere reaction to the ideas of the religious. Atheism
consists only of negation, but it allows for many possible affirmations as
well. The search for such possibilities is what Further Than Atheism is all
about.
