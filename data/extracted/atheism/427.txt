The need for critical thinking skills and a humanistic outlook in our world is
great. This is no less true in the Black community than in others. Many African
Americans have been engulfed by religious irrationality, conned by self-serving
"faith healers", and swayed by dogmatic revisionist historians. Many others,
however, have escaped the oppression of such delusions, and live happy and
upstanding lives free of superstition.

African Americans for Humanism DC (AAH DC) exists to bring these secular
humanists together, to provide a forum for communication, and to facilitate
coordinated action. In an irrational world, those who stand for reason must
stand together.

With some exceptions, AAH DC is held every fourth Saturday of the month at the
Hill Center at the Old Naval Hospital, 921 Pennsylvania Avenue, S.E. Washington
DC.  The Center is located 1.5 blocks from the Eastern Market Metro Station.

All events are crosslisted with the Center for Inquiry–DC  website, Convio,
Facebook, and other sites, so RSVPs on this site constitute a minority of RSVPs
.
