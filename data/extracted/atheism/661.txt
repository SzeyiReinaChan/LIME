Blame the Bishops

Church abuse reports say there have been nearly 11,000 abuse complaints since
1950.

February 27, 2004



WASHINGTON (AP) - A panel of prominent Roman Catholics rebuked U.S. bishops
Friday for failing to stop widespread clerical sex abuse over the last
half-century, calling the leaders' performance ``shameful to the church.'' The
top American bishop pledged that the church's mistakes will never be repeated.



``The terrible history recorded here today is history,'' said Bishop Wilton
Gregory, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.

The exchange came as the National Review Board, a lay watchdog panel formed by
the bishops, issued two highly anticipated studies documenting the molestation
problem from 1950 to 2002.

One report is the first church-sanctioned tally of abuse cases: It found there
have been 10,667 abuse claims over those 52 years. More than 80 percent of the
alleged victims were male and over half said they were between ages 11 and 14
when they were assaulted.

About 4 percent of all American clerics who served during the years studied -
4,392 of the 109,694 priests and others under vows to the church - were accused
of abuse.

Victims' advocates immediately decried the figures as low. ``Thousands of
victims haven't reported and dozens of bishops aren't telling all they know,''
said David Clohessy, national director of the Survivors Network of those Abused
by Priests. ``They have no incentive to.''

The second review-board report examines the causes of the molestation crisis
and puts much of the blame on American bishops for not cracking down on errant
priests.

``This is a failing not simply on the part of the priests who sexually abused
minors but also on the part of those bishops and other church leaders who did
not act effectively to preclude that abuse in the first instance,'' the review
board said.

``These leadership failings have been shameful to the church.''

Gregory said the reports tell ``a tragic story.'' But he assured disillusioned
Catholics that the bishops are fully committed to stamping out abuse.



``I can say with absolute assurance that the bishops now have in place the
means of responding immediately to allegations, assisting victims and removing
offenders from ministry,'' he said.

The John Jay College of Criminal Justice conducted the tally of abuse claims
for review board, receiving survey responses from 97 percent of the 195 U.S.
dioceses, plus 142 religious communities.
