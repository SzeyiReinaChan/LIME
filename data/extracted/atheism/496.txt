'Therefore if logic and reason sets you free, you are free indeed.'*

Black Nonbelievers of Detroit's (BNOD) mission is to serve as a networking and
support vehicle for African American non-theists living in Detroit and
surrounding areas. The organization is not exclusionary; that is, although BNOD
serves as an outreach facility for the African American community, this
function does not mean that this is a separatist organization. BNOD is
inclusive in its approach and strives to uphold the concept of Liberty for all-
regardless of race, ethnicity, or sexuality. We turn away no one, and welcome
alliances with those striving for LGBT rights and dignity, equality for women
(feminism), and the preservation of the separation of church and state. This is
by no means exhaustive.

BNOD is not an online forum: We aim to be an offline presence in South East
Michigan. Join us in creating the community that YOU deserve!

BNOD is a proud member of Detroit CoR, AAFH (African Americans for Humanism),
Foundation Beyond Belief and an American Atheists affiliate.

*John 8:36 (NKJV): Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free
indeed.
