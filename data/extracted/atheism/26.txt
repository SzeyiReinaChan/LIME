Welcome

National Ethical Service is a not for profit organization. We are a
non-governmental organization in association with the United Nations Department
of Public Information and affiliated with the American Ethical Union (AEU), the
federation of Ethical Societies. We dedicate ourselves to promoting and
enhancing the highest principles at the United Nations, the AEU, and the
Culture of Peace worldwide. We understand humanitarian work is vital not only
to the relief of suffering but essential to building a peaceful world.

Our purpose is to promote a consciousness shift toward our comprehensive
interconnectedness as we affirm our identity in ethical culture. We celebrate
the transcendent possibility in ethical culture through the practice of ethical
behavior and joyful engagement in community life. We see ourselves as change
agents who connect with the emerging collective determined to bring about the
evolution of consciousness.

We see our role at the United Nations as advocates for emergent holistic
systems such as peace building, universality in human and earth rights,
pluralism based in transparency and accountability and the affirmation of the
Global Commons. While, originally, the UN was founded upon the sovereignty of
nation states, we now believe that nation states in order to assert their true
sovereignty, must cooperate with one another more effectively. They can do more
to promote economic and cultural diversity, to promote trust and alliances of
civilization. We advocate for our country to adopt and implement those
international instruments both binding and non-binding necessary to promote
world peace. It is time to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, the Convention on the
Rights of the Child, the International Criminal Court, Convention to Eliminate
Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), and to adhere to the legal and spirit of
all Resolutions.
