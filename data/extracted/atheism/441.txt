Meet other local atheists and freethinkers for conversation and friendship.

Space Coast Freethought Association (SCFA) is a nonprofit community of
reason-based individuals organized to facilitate social interaction, promote
the non-theistic, rationalist viewpoint as a valid contribution to public
discourse, reinforce the First Amendment guarantee of separation between
government and religion through education and activism, and work in coalition
with like-minded organizations where joint action is needed to achieve these
goals.

SCFA runs the Brevard Atheist meetup.  Join us for our various social events,
newsletter discussion meetings, and road cleanup.  

We are also an associate member of Americans United for the Separation of
Church and State.
