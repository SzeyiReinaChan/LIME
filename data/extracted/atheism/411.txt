Humanists of the San Joaquin Valley

Putting people first since 1977

HSJV aims to promote and develop a wider support of Humanism. We do not
identify ourselves with any particular political party or with any economic
ideology, nor do we publicly take a position on legislation or projects which
are not directly related to our goals. Individual members, however, are
encouraged to develop their moral concepts and to act on their convictions.


Our aim is to facilitate the application of the scientific method of evaluation
to all levels of living; to avoid binding dogmas and static creeds; to search
for facts rather than authorities; and to concern ourselves with discovering
the good life on this earth.

“Our primary purpose is to establish an organization that will serve the
Humanists in our community with social and educational activities related to
Humanism. Other purposes include promoting Humanism in our community, educating
the public about Humanism, and applying the principles of Humanism to improve
our community and society in general.”


We are affiliated with the American Humanist Association.  We are not
affiliated with the Unitarian Universalists.  They are kind enough to provide
us with a place to meet.
