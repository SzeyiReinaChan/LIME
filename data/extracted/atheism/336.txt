If I Was Voting in Iowa, I'd Still Be Undecided

Iowa in United StatesThe Iowa caucuses are rapidly approaching, and so we will
soon have the first presidential primary vote of 2016. What Iowa voters do does
not always decide the eventual nominees, but the mainstream news media
certainly loves to talk about the "momentum" that can be generated out of Iowa
and New Hampshire. The various campaigns must put some stock in this notion
because they have been focusing quite a bit of effort on these two states.

After having a brief political discussion with someone I met yesterday, I found
myself thinking about politics last night. If I was an Iowa voter who was about
to vote in the primary election, I think I'd have to describe myself as
undecided. If I was going to vote in the Republican primary (which I would not
do if I lived in Iowa), I'd most likely vote for Donald Trump. It is possible
but unlikely that I might actually vote for Trump here in Mississippi. As an
Iowa voter, I'd almost certainly vote in the Democratic primary. And if the
vote was held today, I'd probably vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders. But I have to
say "probably" here rather than "definitely" because I have one major concern
about Sanders that I haven't yet resolved.

How We Talk About Islam and Muslims

Harper's Muslims and Christians

One of the earliest mistakes I made in writing this blog was to use the term
"Christians" without attaching any specifiers. This was a mistake because
Christianity is extremely diverse, and it is difficult to communicate anything
meaningful about the entire group of people who identify themselves as
Christians. Even when it comes to some of what appear to be core tenets of
their faith, Christians can hold rather different beliefs.

It took awhile, but I would gradually learn to refer to "some Christians" or
"Christians who believe..." when I was talking about some but not all
Christians. This was not only more accurate, but it reminded me that whatever I
was saying almost certainly did not apply to all Christians. Similarly, I began
to use terms like "Christian extremists" or "Christian dominionists" when
referring to Christians for whom such labels applied. I'm not suggesting that
any of what I do now is the final word on terminology - only that it represents
some improvement from where I started.

I've made many of the same mistakes when it comes to Islam. Like Christianity,
there isn't much that can be said that applies to all Muslims. Some Muslims are
Islamists who seek to impose Islam on their neighbors. Some are not only
Islamists but jihadists who seek to impose Islam on others through the
application of force. These groups are often referred to collectively as Muslim
extremists.

Rock Music is Still Evil

NYC West Indian Day Parade 2 Shankbone 2009
By David Shankbone [CC BY 3.0]
A left-leaning atheist woman I follow on Twitter whose profile contains the
hashtags #FreedomOfSpeech and #FreeSpeech recently tweeted about how a
particular game should be pulled from Apple's App Store and Google Play because
she objected to some of the game's content...*sigh*. Yep. I guess supporting
freedom of speech just doesn't mean what it used to.

Frankly, it seems like some on the left are now going after games that offend
their politically correct sensibilities in much the same way that some of those
on the right used to go after music and books they considered dangerous,
subversive, or demonic. While many on the left once protested the
pro-censorship push of some right-wing authoritarians, the rise of an
authoritarian left (or regressive left if you prefer) seems to have no problem
embracing the tactics they once opposed.

In such a topsy-turvy world, it is nice to have an anchor, something or someone
who shows that not everything has flipped on its head. Such an anchor lends a
sense of stability, reminding us that not everything has changed so much that
the place is no longer recognizable. It is a source of reassurance, at least in
this sense.

Someone's Choice of Candidate is a Poor Indicator of His or Her Moral Worth

Conflict (1936) 1We are observing Martin Luther King, Jr. Day today here in the
U.S. Instead of writing about civil rights, as I have done in past years, I
thought I'd do something a bit different today. I'd like to take a brief look
at one puzzling example of our politically divided climate.

If I wrote a post here at Atheist Revolution in which I said that I just
returned from Las Vegas, that I had a great time there, and listed various
reasons that Las Vegas is one of my favorite places to visit, I am confident
that nobody reading the post would interpret it as me insisting that they
should go to Las Vegas or that they would enjoy it if they did so. Some might
leave comments disagreeing with my assessment (e.g., saying that they hated
Vegas or that they liked another place much better), but they wouldn't behave
as if I had just told them that they have to like it.

If I were to write a post about a new band I recently discovered in which I
described all the things I liked about their music, nobody would conclude that
I was telling them that they should like this band. Again, some might leave
comments disagreeing with me, but nobody would react as if I had just ordered
them to go buy everything they could find by this band. They would recognize
that they were reading my opinion and regard themselves as free to take it or
leave it.

How David Bowie Influenced Me

David Bowie - TopPop 1974 04
By AVRO [CC BY-SA 3.0]
As you know, the world lost a great one recently in the form of David Bowie. I
thought it was time for me to join the chorus of voices expressing sadness at
his passing and attempting to communicate how he affected me.

I always tell people that David Bowie was the first rock concert I ever
attended. Technically, this isn't true. I had seen 3-4 other acts live before
Bowie. But I've always thought of Bowie as my first. Why? His was the first
concert I was allowed to attend that required a 90 minute drive to the big
city. It was the first that caused me to come home late at night reeking of
tobacco and whatever else was in the air that night. It was the first one for
which I was excited and the first for which I went out of my way. The previous
ones were at the state fair on days I had already planned to be there or at one
of a couple nearby parks. They featured acts I'd never heard of or that I
didn't care for. I went only because a friend wanted to go. Bowie was
different.

I think I was about 15 when I saw Bowie. My exposure to him up to this point
would have been limited to what would have been played on top-40 radio during
the mid-80s (e.g., Let's Dance, Blue Jean, China Girl). My exposure to
contemporary music up to this point was mostly limited to top-40 radio. I
recognized that at least half of what I heard there was crap, but I didn't know
where to find what I sensed I was missing. The first time I had heard an entire
album of Bowie's was a few days before the show. I was going to the concert
with a friend and his older brother and sister. The older brother was into
Bowie, had several albums, and insisted that I hear a couple before the show.
"You know he's not just going to play the few songs you've heard on the radio,
right?"
