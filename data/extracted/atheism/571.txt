  • Join us!

Freethinkers, humanists, skeptics, agnostics, atheist and all non-believers are
welcome! A meeting of minds where we can share ideas, ask questions, teach,
learn and grow, benefiting from each others life stories and thoughts. Our
meetings are very informal and friendly.  We meet at least once a month but we
also have other gatherings throughout the year.  In addition, we are in contact
with other freethought groups in the Seattle/Tacoma area and we enjoy going to
their events as well.  There is always something happening in this awesome
community of ours.  Check us out, we know you are out there!

We're 214 Freethinkers
