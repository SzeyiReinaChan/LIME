About

Have a question for an atheist ? Ever wonder what atheists think about
morality, faith, science, etc ? How do atheists live their lives without a god
? How do they know right from wrong ? Are they just angry at god ? Do they
really NOT believe ?

Hopefully this site will give you all of the answers you are looking for and
more. Asktheatheist.com is a joint project where all atheists are encouraged to
answer questions in either text, audio, or video formats. Think you have a
better way to explain it ? Share it with everyone ! The idea is to have a
variety of answers towards the same questions and in doing so, hopefully find a
variety of ways to open people up to understanding atheism and atheists.

Email us !

Send your question via email to asktheREMOVE4SPAMatheist@gmail.com
