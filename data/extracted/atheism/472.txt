[event_1273]

We are dedicated to building a community of atheists, agnostics, freethinkers,
skeptics, etc. within the Iowa Corridor. We exist to allow non-religious people
to share their thoughts, ideas, and viewpoints. The Corridor A-Team is meant to
be a place where we can be ourselves and enjoy our various interests without
religion or other superstitions playing a central role.

We have lots of information in our "About" section on the menu at the top, so
check it out!

If you can't find answers to your questions there, please feel free to email us
at info@corridor-a-team.com.

Hope to see you soon!

"Eastern Iowa Corridor A-Team kicks ass! They scare me, and I'm not easily

"They are the best and they specialize in the ridiculous!"- Capt. Charisa Sosa
