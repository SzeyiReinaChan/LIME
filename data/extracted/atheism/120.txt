    Together we are fighting for justice, truth and equality for all, speaking
    out for those who can’t, exposing bad science, and fighting against the
    tyranny of oppressive ideology. We are here to inspire the next generation
    of godless heroes, avenge the harms of religion, educate the uninformed,
    and ensure the well-being of all individuals by defending the separation of
    church and state.
