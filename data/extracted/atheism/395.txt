Joplin Freethinkers was organized in January 2009. We hold that beliefs should
be formed on the basis of science and logic rather than emotion, authority,
tradition or dogma. We advocate the use of reason, defend the separation of
church and state and support human rights, civil rights, tolerance and equality
for all. Our goal is to provide a social and intellectual community for those
who promote these principles.

Mission Statement: "To represent, organize,

and unite the secular citizens of southwest

Missouri by promoting the ideals of rationality"
