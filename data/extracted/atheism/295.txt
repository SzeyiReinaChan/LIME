  • We work on behalf of non-religious people who seek to live ethical lives on
    the basis of reason and humanity. We promote Humanism, a secular state, and
    equal treatment of everyone regardless of religion or belief. Our
    celebrants provide non-religious funeral, wedding, and naming ceremonies.

  • Humanists

    Happy Humanism BadgeThink for themselves about what is right and wrong,
    based on reason and respect for others.

    Find meaning, beauty, and joy in the one life we have, without the need for
    an afterlife.

    Look to science instead of religion as the best way to discover and
    understand the world.

    Believe people can use empathy and compassion to make the world a better
    place for everyone.

    Are you a humanist? Take our quick quiz to find out.

  • Our Campaigns

    'Faith' Schools
    We want pupils from all different backgrounds educated together in a shared
    environment, rather than separated according to the religious beliefs of
    their parents.

    Take Action
    Secularism
    We want a country where institutions such as Parliament are separate from
    religious organisations, and everyone is treated equally, regardless of
    their beliefs.

    Equality & Human Rights
    As humanists, we support the right of every person to be treated with
    dignity and respect, and to be allowed to speak, and believe, as they wish.

    Bishops in the House of Lords
    26 Church of England Bishops sit as of right in the House of Lords,
    amending legislation. This unique privilege is unfair, unjustified and
    unpopular.

    Assisted Dying
    We believe individuals should have a right to decide to end their life if
    they are suffering, and that relatives and doctors should be able to assist
    that person.

    Pseudoscience
    NHS funding is spent on homeopathy, despite no evidence that it has health
    benefits beyond the placebo effect. This could be spent on other treatment.

    Animal Welfare
    UK law requires that animals killed for food are stunned before slaughter,
    as this is the most humane method – except with religious slaughter such as
    kosher and some halal, where there are exemptions.
