J. R. "BOB" DOBBS has ENTERED THIS WORLD... and he is GAINING IN SLACK & POWER
EVERY DAY! Hour of Slack Radio is streamed new every week. A NEW SALE DAWNS in
both of our CATALOGS. The SubGenius music CDs are now downloadable! THE BOOK OF
THE SUBGENIUS is here! SubGenius events are happening all over the world this
year. X-DAY is held at an exotic site (in darkest Ohio!) every July! The
exciting new do-it-yourself virus we invented for the SubGenius Art Mines is
spreading throughout our website, sometimes spilling over even into the
so-called "reality" that we SubGenii are forced to share with the humans. The
vigorous health of this virus is the result of its careful design by an
ever-growing team of SubGenius coders -- Slack-filled young men and women of
Yeti descent who are spread, SEEMINGLY randomly, throughout the breakthinking
world... but are bent on breaching all Earthly human political and cultural
barriers with the searing nonhuman truth of the Word of "Bob": J.R. "Bob"
Dobbs, that LIVING GOD WHO WALKS THIS PLANET EARTH IN HUCKSTER'S SHOES.

SubGenius Graphics Orgy:

Complex graphics best viewed one at a time -- the latest in SubGenius
non-moving pictures.

Welcome to the wide open, wide-screen, dilated-pupilled world of SubGenius

indistinguishable, but for some of us, it gets to where we PREFER the hideous
stuff.

  • THE ART MINES
    START HERE. ALL of our full-brain, eye-rip graphics. ALL OF THEM. Over 23
    "Tunnels," each containing a dozen or two entire galleries. The latest in
    SubGenius non-moving pictures. (FIND YOUR DOBBSHEADS HERE).
  • THE EYE OF "BOB"
    Includes special (older) graphics SubSections, such as the prehistoric SubG
    Video Archives, our GWAR and M/TV adventures, Olde Nenslo, and the PORTRAIT
    GALLERY of LIVING SUBGENIUS GODS and TOPLESS GODDESSES.

More Fun Than You Really Wanted. (As always, hear THE HOUR OF SLACK podcasts
for the latest and longest in SubGenius audio. These stashes below are from the
earliest days of Internet sound,)

Praise the Really Rather Rancid Rev. Error! For this mighty SubGenius has, by
remote control, from merry Warwickshire, England, TOTALLY RENOVATED an
abandoned section of SubSITE that had long lain fallow: the SMALL, SHORT,
DOWNLOADABLE SOUND CLIPS vaults, previously called "THE EARS OF "BOB"".
