Lincoln Atheists

Mission Statement

Lincoln Atheists is a non-profit educational organization dedicated to building
a positive community for non-theists; fostering secular viewpoints; supporting
charitable contributions to society; protecting and promoting the separation of
church and state.

What do we do?

We meet to discuss beliefs and philosophies, share ideas, give people a sense
of community and, hopefully, make some new friends.
Lincoln Atheists is a local affiliate of American Atheists.
