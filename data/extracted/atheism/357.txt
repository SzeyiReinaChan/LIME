Southern Bacon Burqa Barbie


I've been thinking about Southern Bacon Burqa Barbie for a few days. Last week
I got two pounds of bacon and got a Southern Barbie doll. They've been waiting
to meet their destiny on YouTube and the blogs.

At long last, here is Southern Bacon Burqa Barbie.

If it's popular I still have the Barbie AND I have another pound of bacon in
the fridge.

Parenting Without "What Would Jesus Do?"


[MFA]
Took this at the Fine Arts Museum
in Boston.
My son is 13 years old. Fictitious god willing, he will live to an old age. But
he is 13 years old, and that means he's hip deep in puberty (he grew an inch
since June). Any cursory look at crime statistics and YouTube videos of extreme
sports will make a parent think Teenage boys are prone to stupid acts of
stupidity which can easily qualify them for the Darwin Awards.

(Look, for those of you who are teenage guys reading this with butt hurt you
may feel a little better knowing there is no age related demographic I am in
love with.)

I Don't Believe In Asteroids And Boston Comic Con

[hurry]


I brought my kids to Boston Comic Con a few weeks ago. My daughter (10 years
old) was very excited and got herself a new My Little Pony dress for the
occasion. And let me say that getting the dress took some time and effort, my
friends. First her mum looked online and saw that Target carried the dress, but
you couldn't order online. Then I went over with my daughter to the closest
store only to find out that the dress was a clearance item and that there were
no more around. There were a few tears shed over the sad turn of events.
However, the second Target we went to had the outfit and the day was saved. In
related news, my son (13 years old) had some sort of Illuminati t-shirt on for
the event.

Explaining A Logical Fallacy At The Pub


I want to tell you all, I am God. Well, I'm going to be playing God in a
locally (Boston) made short film. It's an interesting project, and it's going
to be a silent film done in the style of film pioneer Geroges Melies, the man
behind the classic movie A Trip to the Moon. What? You don't know it? Here it
is:

Non-Bullshit Parenting

I was over at the Friendly Atheist, and checking out a clip from Jon Stewart
talking about the ambient bullshit that exists in our society. If you haven't
seen it, it's worth a gander.

As a dad I try to point out bullshit to my kids as it occurs in real time. Of
course, that can lead to situations like the one below.

[Dad]

[Dd2]

Yeah, that's a true story.

Boy Scouts Of America And Other Updates


Two people in the whole wide world have actually seen me go full-balls into the
subject of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). It wasn't pretty. My rant occurred
the same night which caused me to swear off gin. I was knocking back gin and
tonics like they were water. (I'd like to say this happened a long time ago
when I didn't know any better, but I was in my mid-forties.) My rant started
innocently enough with the subject of the British monarchy (unsurprisingly I am
a small r republican), and then the BSA came up in conversation. That was the
thing that spiraled me into a red faced, Bid them achieve me and then sell my
bones  state of mind.

But I'm better now.

However, the BSA is one of my, well, we'll call it pet peeve and not obsession.
That sounds healthier, psychologically speaking. Their recent decision to allow
some gay scout leaders in some of their troops requires derision. I thought I
would give you all a chance for the airing of grievances -- even though its not
Festivus --  over at my Patheos blog, Laughing in Disbelief. I wrote a post
titled Boy Scouts Of America Fill In the Blank! I hope you go over there and
lob a comment or two.

Otherwise, my kids are out of town next week. This summer has been a grind for
me with working four jobs, getting the new blog off the ground, and making a
good faith attempt at being a decent father. I plan to write the monthly email
letter next week to Purgatory subscribers and catch up on some much needed
sleep.

LiP
