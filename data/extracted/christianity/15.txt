Facts

Feastday: May 23

Birth: 1698

Death: 1764

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This holy priest was born in 1698 at the village of Voltaggio in the diocese of
Genoa and was one of the four children of an excellent and highly respected
couple. When he ws ten a nobleman and his wifre who were spending the summer at
Voltaggio obtained permission from his parents to take him back with them to
Genoa to be trained in their house. He remained with them three years, winning
golden opinions from all, notably from two Capuchin friars who came to his
patrons home. They carried such a favourable report of the boy to his uncle who
was then minister provincial of the Capuchins that a cousin Lorenzo Rossi a
canon of Santa Maria in Cosmedin invited him to come to Rome. The offer was
accepted and he entered the Roman College at the age of thirteen. Popular with
his teachers and with his fellow pupils he had completed the classical course
with distinction when the reading of an ascetical book led him to embark on
exfessive mortifications. The strain on his strength at a time when he was
working hard led to a complete breakdown which boliged him to leave the roman
College. He recovered sufficiently to complete his training at the Minerva, but
he never was again relly robust. ndeed his subsequent labours were performed
under the handicap of almost constant suffering.

On March 8, 1721 at the age of twenty three he was ordained and his first Mass
was celebrated in the Roman College at the altar of St. Aloysius Gonzaga to
whom he always had a special devotion.

His fame came from his work as a confessor and as his ministry to the sick.
