We are a compassionate congregation dedicated to honoring  the Lord, obeying
Tanakh, and reaching out to bring the message of true, lasting peace and joy to
the hearts of Jews and Gentiles in our Metro Detroit community in Southeast
Michigan.

 

We cordially invite you to join us for our Shabbat services, held every
Saturday at 10:30 AM. 


If you have a spiritual need, are seeking God, or would just

like more information about our ministry, we would love to

hear from you. Call us at (248)546-8009 or email cbethmessiah@sbcglobal.net

Please allow 2-3 business days for a response.
