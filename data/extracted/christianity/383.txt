A Warm Welcome from Pastor Ann Duncan

Welcome to St. Timothy United Methodist Church! I look forward to meeting you
in person and introducing you to this wonderful community of faith. St. Timothy
UMC has become well-known for its warm and genuine hospitality to all, its
inspiring and uplifting worship, and its compassionate ministry to others in so
many places. St. Timothy is a place where we are growing in our faith, we are
using our gifts and talents to make a difference, and we are excited about what
Christ is doing among us. Come check it out for yourself and see why so many
people are choosing to call St. Timothy their church homeI
