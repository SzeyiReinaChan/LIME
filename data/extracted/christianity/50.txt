The Everlasting God
[a22f94100d]

Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations. Before the
mountains were born or you brought forth the whole world, from everlasting to
everlasting you are God. Psalm 90:1-2

Do you not know? Have you not heard? The Lord (Jesus) is the everlasting God,
the Creator of the ends of the earth. He will not grow tired or weary, and his
understanding no one can fathom. Isaiah 40:28

You will keep in perfect peace those whose minds are steadfast, because they
trust in you. Trust in the Lord forever, for the Lord, the Lord himself, is the
Rock eternal. Isaiah 26:3-4

God, the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone
is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can
see. To him be honor and might forever. Amen. 1 Timothy 6:15b-16

Praise God!!!
