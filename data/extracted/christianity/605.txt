Orphanages

Christian Orphanages

Christian orphanages the world over are in need of aid, support and simple
helping hands. But most of all, these children are in need of something,
someone to believe in.

A father to the fatherless, God reminds us that children hold a special place
in His heart. Through the help of missionaries like you, lives are changed in
an instant. Teens and students who are newbies to missions or missionaries who
cut their teeth in the field, Christian orphanages are by far a favorite place
to serve among those who are called according to His purpose.

Come help feed His children. Stay long term and teach them to read or stay a
few weeks and just teach them to laugh again . . . no matter how long you stay
you will teach them about His boundless grace and endless love.

Though you may only spend a few days among these Christian orphanages in your
lifetime, the children who live there for much of theirs will carry your love
and introduction to His with them as long as they live. Even more still, you’ll
carry the blessing of being a blessing with you every day of your life.

“Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child
she has borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you! See! I have carved
you on the palms of My hands.’’
Isaiah 49:15-16 NIV
