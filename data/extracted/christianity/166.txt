Welcome

On behalf of the congregation of Ebenezer Presbyterian Church, welcome to our
web home. We’re glad to have you visit us and learn how God is using our
church. Our ministry can be explained in four words:

Reach: connecting people to Jesus Christ for salvation.
Teach: connecting people to his Word for growth.
Love: connecting people to each other for fellowship
Serve: connecting people to personal ministry and service

The word “Ebenezer” is found in the Bible in I Samuel 7:12 and means “stone of
help.” Our goal as a church is to be a “stone of help” both locally and
globally as we point people to the one who is the true “Stone of help” – Jesus
Christ.

God planted Ebenezer in 1785 and his faithfulness has been evident from the
beginning.

We trust that this site will give you a good idea of who we are as a church.
After you visit us here we invite you to come for a visit on Sunday to
experience God at work in Ebenezer firsthand.

Cordially in Christ,
The Ebenezer Family
