Max Liebster - The Unveiling of a Monument in Reichenbach / Lautertal,
Odenwald, Germany

The Unveiling of a Monument in Reichenbach / Lautertal, Odenwald, Germany

This memorial to Max Liebster, honorary citizen of Reichenbach, should remind
us of all who have suffered unjustly under the National Socialist regime, and
stimulate us to think about our own values and goals.

<< What enabled us to offer moral resistance and stay firm in the face of a
tyrannical state ?

Drawing by Simone Arnold, 12, subjected to a grilling in Mulhouse (Alsace),
March 1943Our strong convictions helped us reject omnipresent propaganda,
respond to hateful persecution with love and forgiveness, and conquer despair
thanks to our firm hope.

May these reflections, testimonies, and narratives help our visitors understand
that intolerance leads to exclusion, persecution, and ultimately annihilation.

May these historical accounts likewise inspire strength and courage in those
suffering oppression of all kinds. >>
