Book of the Month

geo101_shelf
Geocentrism 101

How do you cram over five hundred years of science and history into a small
book of just over 200 pages and not only make it easy to read but as
understandable as Reader’s Digest? Well, that feat has been accomplished by
author Robert Sungenis in an easy-to-carry paperback book on a 6 x 9 frame.
Whereas his massive three volume set, Galileo Was Wrong: The Church Was Right,
now in its ninth edition, is over 2400 pages long, the best and boldest of that
famous set has been distilled down for you into less than one tenth the size.
