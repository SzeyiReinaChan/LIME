                             Our Mission Statement

  We are a community of all ages who seek to respond to God's love in Jesus.
  We believe we should: worship God, care for one another and our neighbours.
               Help each other to grow in faith, hope and love. 
                         Share the good news of Jesus.

Welcome

Reaching Out

We as a Church are reaching out into the local community and to as many people
as possible to share our love of God. This is not just in word but by example,
we encourage the use of our building for community activities or groups and in
doing this we hope to engage with others in creating positive links within the
local area.
All are always welcome at Newchurch.
