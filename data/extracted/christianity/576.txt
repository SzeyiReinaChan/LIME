WELCOME TO ST. PAUL'S !

Ours is a warm, friendly congregation that is both genuinely welcoming and
supportive of others in their own faith journeys.  As our Parish Mission
Statement says: “We are a diverse community of people who have received God’s
love, and so we strive to show, share and tell of that love to everyone."  We
are young and old, black and white, single, married, divorced and widowed, gay
and straight, and everything in between.  Our diversity is our strength and
helps us serve God and our community as we try to live out the Gospel in our
daily lives.  God's love is real, it changes lives and the world around us.  We
invite you to experience his love for yourself and share it with us.
