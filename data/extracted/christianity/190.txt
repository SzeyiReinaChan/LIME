    but great family focused and orientated content. Thank you for your
    outreach in our community and body. I pray you continue with Gods plan and
    have all the means necessary to go forth with this mission. God bless.. and

Mark Reitmeier

    "Love you guys. So happy to have a local radio station that speaks God’s
    love."


Stephen Mathias

    "Bless you and thank you for serving the Lord :)"


Karla Atwater

    "Having moved from Roslyn, Pennsylvania (suburb of Philadelphia) to
    Clearbrook, Minnesota (population 518) this past August, we were hoping for
    a Christian radio station that would play contemporary Christian music and
    minister to us through that music. YourQFM has become that station. Thank
    you for your ministry and God bless you as you continue to serve Him."


James & Patricia Galloway

    "Keep up the good work! I have been listening to Q107 since I was a kid and
    I am always encouraged! Since becoming a pastor, its been great to listen
    to music in the trenches of spiritual warfare. A lot of the music I heard
    on Q107 was of great value to me when I was deployed to Afghanistan as a
    chaplain’s assistant. God bless you guys and continue to be faithful
    stewards of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and continue to preach the truth no
    matter what."


Josiah Hoagland

    "I love this radio station and I love that you make it possible to lift
    others up in their time of need. You truly are God working through us on
    Earth!!!"

Verse of the Day

So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of you
who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. There is
neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female,
for you are all one in Christ Jesus. — Galatians 3:26-28 (NIV)
