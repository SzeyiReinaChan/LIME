said a mouthful, but you might find people looking at you like you haven’t

WELCOME TO FIRST CHRISTIAN CHURCH!

Please take a few moments to check things out.  Feel free to browse around to
find out more about the wonderful faith family here at FCCBRLA!

 

Join us for a Sunday morning worship service.[First]

We have two weekly opportunities for worship on Sunday morning--you're welcome
to explore and experience both.  We offer an infant and toddler nursery, and 
Children's Worship & Wonder during both services, so there is something for the
whole family. Click here to view our Worship Times and Directions.

Get involved.

At the heart of our church is our people, so we try to provide something for
everyone with a variety of groups and activities. Our fellowship groups provide
the opportunity to experience growth and build new relationships. We offer
wonderful Music Ministires, several Youth Ministries, Men's Bible Study,
Women's Ministries and Bible Studies.  There are many types of groups that
all meet at various times and places. To learn more about what's available
click here.

Invite others to join you in this journey.

Once you have realized what a great place FCCBRLA is, you will want to share it
with others. As long as there are people who don’t know the full love of
Christ, there will always be room for more people here!  Let us know what we
can do to help spread the love of Christ and the news about this great
community of faith!
