 Theology Thursday: Are you stressed?

 Photo of contributor

 Posted by John Percival, 7 Jan 2016

 Happy New Year from the team at Church Society! We've had a bit of a blog break
 during the second half of December, one of the busiest times of the church
 year. It can also be one of the most stressful, balancing the massive
 opportunities for outreach with our human need for rest and time for family and
 friends. Then the New Year arrives at 100mph! So perhaps the question is not,
 "Are you stressed?" but, "What are you stressed about?" The next edition of
 Churchman will be dropping through your door in the next few days (apologies
 for the delays in production!) and we can offer an exclusive web preview of
 Simon Vibert's article on the topic of stress.

 Vibert begins his article exploring some of the distinctively Christian
 stresses as well as the cultural factors relating to stress. He draws on
 anecdotal evidence as well as academic research to present an overview of the
 causes and symptoms of stress. These shed light on why serving Jesus (in
 whatever capacity) can be a challenging experience. His working definition is
 as follows: “Stress is what we experience when we feel out of control.”

 Five things to pray cover

 Ministry Monday: Praying for my church

 Photo of contributor

 Posted by Tom Woolford, 14 Dec 2015

 Tom Woolford brings our attention to a new book on prayer which aims to help us
 pray the big picture of our local church’s identity and mission.

 “We will turn this responsibility over to them and will give our attention to
 prayer and the ministry of the word” (Acts 6:3-4).

 Despite obvious differences to the role of the Twelve in the early church,
 those of us engaged in (or, as in my case, training for) ordained ministry are
 – in a similar way to the apostles – released from many responsibilities that
 otherwise would rightly claim our time and energy (such as the need to earn our
 keep from secular employment) in order that we might use that released time and
 energy to serve God’s people in prayer and word-ministry. Those people in the
 pews are earning and giving money towards my keep because they want me to spend
 my time praying and preaching. My prayer life is therefore not private: the
 church has a vested interest in it!
