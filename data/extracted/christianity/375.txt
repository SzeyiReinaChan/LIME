       Register for an LDS Home Ed email group.
             We have two different groups.
   One group is a talkative group where a variety of
                subjects are discussed.
    The other group is for home school topics only.

If you wish to register, please click on the envelope.

            LDS Home Education Email Group

                            ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

These email groups are for Home School Mothers
 who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints who have made the decision
 to join those who can't bear the thoughts of
 someone else having the joy of watching their
           children grow and learn.
This group is not for mothers just considering
   Home School or who have their children in
 Private School. We hope you do these things,
but for now, we have chosen to limit membership
to only those mothers who currently teach their
          children in their own home.

            my Child to Preschool?

   If you are already a member of this email
   group, or if you are curious about group
                 restrictions
    please feel free to read our standard
            Registration Response.
