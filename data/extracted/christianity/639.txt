  Wednesday morning book club is currently reading “The Book Thief” by Markus
    Zusak. Book club is open to anyone that enjoys reading and discussion.
                                       
                             What they’re saying…

    My family loves coming to Jubilatte. It is my youngest son’s favorite stop
    in the morning. The boys play in the sweet children’s area while I enjoy a
        hot cuppa. The prices are super affordable and it’s just a warm and
              welcoming atmosphere. We stop in as often as possible!

                                 Wendy Coffman

    I am honored and thrilled to serve as a volunteer “pastorista” at Jubilatte
     on Thursday mornings. I love coming in early in the morning, turning the
    lights on, getting things going, smelling the coffee brew.   As the morning
       goes along, I get to be a part of lots of gatherings: moms with moms;
      couples; meetings; people working; men “taking a break”.  Jubilatte is
                           definitely good for my soul.
