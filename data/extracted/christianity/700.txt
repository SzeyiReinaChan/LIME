Welcome To Vista de la Montaña United Methodist Church

Thank you for visiting our  website .  We hope that after you check us out
online, you’ll visit our campus.  Join us on Sunday mornings for worship
service at 10 am,  a blend of traditional and contemporary services.   We offer
Sunday school for children pre-kindergarten and up, and nursery care for the
babies and toddlers.  We also offer an adult education class at 11:15 am.  In
