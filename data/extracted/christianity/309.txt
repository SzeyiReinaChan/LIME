                          meeting at

                        Hayfield Road,

                   Kirkcaldy, Fife, Scotland

    welcomes you and invites you to discover more about the
                   Christians who meet here.

 Here you will find details of our meeting times; information
tracts which you may read online or download to print and read
at your leisure; an opportunity to take correspondence courses,
  or online study courses, to help your understanding of the
  scriptures; some online quizzes to test that knowledge; and
information about the history of our congregation in this town
          (a history which goes back over 200 years).

  It is our prayer that you find information here which will
enable you to join with us - and many others around the world -
                              in:

                     "Going By The Book".
