Carpenter's Chapel United Methodist Church

The  Glorious Beauty Of Christmas Eve Candlelight!
 
One of the loveliest worship events of the whole year. Carpenter’s Chapel UMC
invites you and yours to the timeless ritual of celebrating the Light Of The
World. We’ll gather to sing carols, hear The Word,  see each other’s smiling
faces, and then pass the Christ Light and see the entire sanctuary aglow.
 
Come join us at 41181 Hwy 933 in Prairieville, Thursday 6:30. When you’re here,
you’re home!

  **Gluten-free Eucharist WILL be available from now on. If you’ve ever known
 anyone who suffers from Celiac (allergy to wheat flour or any wheat product)
you know how miserable it can be. We’ve had a request for gluten-free Eucharist
 and it will now be offered every Communion Sunday in addition to the regular
                         loaf.. Simply ask the server.
                                        
 **Gathering for a meal following a funeral is a vital ministry. With all the
grief and stress during those times, eating is a hit-or-miss issue for all. So,
 most churches offer a Bereavement Meal following the services so that will be
 one item they family/friends don’t worry about. Debbie Mosher has coordinated
     our Bereavement Meals but with a 2^nd =grandbaby on the way she needs
   replacement or a co-coordinator. There’s no shortage of people willing to
      prepare, but it’s the coordination we need. Call Debbie at 603-7068

   **So you don’t think you’re an Evangelist? Really? Just because you can’t
 preach, teach Bible lessons, sing solos in church or quote scripture doesn’t
mean you’re not an evangelist. All you have to do is SHARE your love of God and
  God’s church and God’s people! That’s why children are such a delight. They
 can’t wait to share something they’re enthusiastic about. You can do it too!
INVITE someone to church, and THIS Sunday is as good a time as ever. Tell them
     how meaningful you feel worship is or any other aspect of the church.
