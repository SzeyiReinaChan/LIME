Welcome!



Ridgewood is a different kind of Baptist church. We are an open community where
the doubts and questions of life are just as important as the certainties
and answers. We strive to be a thinking, feeling, healing community of faith
where everyone is welcome. That means everyone.

Maybe you come having never missed a Sunday service. Maybe you come having
never entered a church building before. Maybe you are coming back to church
after many years away. Wherever you are on life’s journey, please know that you
are welcome here at Ridgewood Baptist Church. 

Your questions are welcome. 
Your celebrations are welcome.
Your sorrows are welcome.
Your joys are welcome.
You are welcome.
Just the way you are.

We believe that Jesus Christ is the source of new life, and that we have been
called to be a thinking, feeling, and healing community of faith which shares
the story of how Christ's love is changing the direction of our lives.

​Ridgewood Baptist Church is in an ongoing partnership with Highland Baptist
Church which provides pastoral leadership and volunteer support to Ridgewood's
efforts to be a dynamic, progressive voice of faith in Southwest Jefferson
County.
