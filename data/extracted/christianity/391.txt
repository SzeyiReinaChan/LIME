                           CRABB FAMILY LEGACY AVAILABLE DIGITALLY FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER

                           The Crabb Family, one of the most celebrated family groups to ever
                           grace a stage, has partnered with Syntax Creative to offer, for the
                           first time, its entire catalog at digital service providers such as 
                           iTunes,Amazon and Spotify. The Crabb Family’s legacy of musical
                           excellence includes 15 No. 1 songs, multiple Grammy nominations, 11 GMA
                           Dove Awards and numerous other awards and accolades reflecting the
                           power of God’s word through music.

                           Previously, most of the celebrated family’s music was available only on
                           CD’s and cassettes. Some titles were available digitally. However, this
                           marks the first time the entire Crabb Family discography is being
                           offered digitally.

                           “We are excited to work with Timothy and his team at Syntax. It’s
                           wonderful to be able to release this entire catalog of songs, some
                           music that has been locked away in a vault or only available at our
                           concerts,” Jason Crabb said. “So many times we get asked if we have a
                           song that is no longer available because someone has lost a CD or
                           cassette. Now, they can rest assured that everything will be available
                           at their favorite digital service provider.”

                           “The Crabb Family has toured and recorded professionally for over two
                           decades. Many of the songs and projects that formed the foundation of
                           their musical legacy have been unavailable in digital format until
                           now,” Timothy Trudeau, CEO of Syntax Creative, said. “Today, we are
                           excited to announce that we’re changing that.”

                           Here’s a list of the titles available through this deal at your

                           “There are many providers of digital distribution. After careful due
                           diligence by our team and through recommendations from labels who
                           currently partner with Syntax, the choice was clear for us as a
                           company,” Philip Morris, manager of Jason Crabb, said. “We also love
                           the fact that the staff of Syntax are professing Christians which makes
                           us feel equally yoked in this partnership.”

                           “When I met Philip and Tina Morris, I knew that I wanted to work with
                           them,” Trudeau said. “They embody the business part of the music
                           business — extremely professional, thoughtful and thorough. The fact
                           that they are pleasant is just a bonus.”

                           The Crabb Family has always infused a variety of styles and influences
                           into their musical offerings. This multiple Grammy-nominated and 11
                           time GMA Dove Award-winning family reached a worldwide audience through
                           television and concert appearances. What started from their small
                           country church in rural Kentucky, to the bright lights of the big city
                           at Carnegie Hall and everywhere in between, The Crabb Family has blazed
                           a trail all its own, leaving a legacy of musical excellence and
                           impacting countless lives throughout its career. Jason Crabb’s Through
                           the Fire Ministries, LLC, is the proprietor of The Crabb Family
