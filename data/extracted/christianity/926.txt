Our Beliefs
Wesley UMC is committed to being a place where all people can come to encounter
God and feel His presence.  The people at Wesley are a family of believers who
reach out to each other and our community to show the love of Jesus Christ in
tangible ways.  We are committed to serving others in love and grace and
believe in prayer as the foundation for all things as we pray for our town, our
country and our nation to seek and turn to Him.
