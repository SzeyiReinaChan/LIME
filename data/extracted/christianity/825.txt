[checker]              Sarah Mallet: 18th Century Preacher               [round]
                                    _Home Page                            


Sarah Mallet (1764-1846) was one of
the very small group of women,
authorised by John Wesley to become a
preacher, in the early days of
Methodism.

After Wesley's death, she married,
and as Sarah Boyce, she continued to
preach for another forty years -
despite the ban on female preaching,
imposed by the Wesleyan Methodist
Church in 1803.

Very little has been written about
her - and the few 'facts' that are
mentioned now turn out to be
inaccurate in many cases. Following
exhaustive research, and the
discovery of a number of original
documents that had not been seen by                  [weslett]
previous writers on this subject, a
biography of her (containing many
previously unpublished details) was
written by David East.

Would you like to know more about
women preachers, and Sarah in
particular ?

The best source is the book My Dear
Sally which was published (by World
Methodist Historical Society
Publications) in May 2003, priced at
five pounds (UK - sterling). If you
would like a copy, or if you have any
information about which the author
might be interested, please contact
