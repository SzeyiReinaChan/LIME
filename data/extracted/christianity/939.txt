      Jesus loves you and so do we!  Enterprise is a loving church made up of
 ordinary people whose lives have been changed by Jesus Christ.  Everything at
 Enterprise revolves around worshiping God, growing believers and sharing
 Jesus with the world.  

  

 Worshiping God

  Not once a week in a "service," but everyday with our lives.   

 Growing Believers

  Helping each other learn to have a strong relationship with God.  

 Sharing Jesus 

  Telling the world that Jesus saves and changes lives!  

  

      As you look around this website, we hope that you will be able to get a
 glimpse of the wonderful ways God is empowering us to accomplish these great
 tasks.  This site also has some information that we hope you will find
 helpful.  Check back with us regularly as we will be updating our information
 and adding more resources.

  

 May the Lord Jesus Christ richly bless you today!
