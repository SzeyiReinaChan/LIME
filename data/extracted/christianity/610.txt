Welcome to Dover United Methodist Church

Thank you for visiting our church’s website. If you are looking for a loving
church family in the Dover area, then we invite to visit us as we seek to live
in God’s love together.

There are many opportunities to get plugged in to the Dover UMC community,
including study and volunteer options. See the Worship tab for information
about our services and times, as well as a link to our audio sermons.
