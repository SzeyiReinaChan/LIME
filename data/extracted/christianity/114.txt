Welcome to AbbaOil.com

August 2015 marked our 20th anniversary producing Biblical fragrant Anointing
Oil products and we are excited to share with you, our customers, the greatest
and most rewarding adventure of our lives.  From the very beginning in 1995 Our
Father has done “exceedingly, abundantly, beyond what we could ask or think”! 
Our story is filled with wonderful divine connections, divine encounters,
divine inspiration and His Divine favor.  Most importantly, His divine touch
and presence is evidenced with the anointing of these precious oils. Below is
one testimony of the many hundreds we have received over the years.

”I started using your Frankincense and Myrrh to anoint my son and myself years
ago, with my faith in Jesus as our healer my son and I have almost never been
sick and that has been true for years”.   

It is our joy to anoint and pray for every person who visits us in Houston.  We
also pray for every person who orders over the phone and would be delighted to
pray for you as well from 9am-4pm CST Monday-Friday. 

Please visit our Testimonies page to read more of the remarkable stories of
WHAT THE LORD HAS DONE!
