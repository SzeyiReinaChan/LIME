Covenant Service - Jan 3rd

I am no longer my own, but yours.
Put me to what you will, rank me with whom you will;
put me to doing, put me to suffering;
let me be employed for you, or laid aside for you,
exalted for you, or brought low for you;
let me be full,
let me be empty,
let me have all things,
let me have nothing:
I freely and wholeheartedly yield all things
to your pleasure and disposal.
And now, glorious and blessed God,
Father, Son and Holy Spirit,
you are mine and I am yours. So be it.
And the covenant now made on earth, let it be ratified in heaven.
Amen.

of the way, and will be in the year ahead. So read with wonder this snapshot of
life at Trinity Church and give thanks to God, praying too for wisdom in the
year ahead. Every Blessing Ian

traditional themes of Advent speak so powerfully into today’s world. There are
at least four sets of Advent themes I am aware of - each set usually linked to
the lighting of Advent Candles in church on the four Sundays before Christmas.
