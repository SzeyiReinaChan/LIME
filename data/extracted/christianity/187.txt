We believe that God’s radical hospitality calls Manitou Conference to:

  • Journey into new ways of being church and,
  • Understand and engage with the struggle for dignity and economic justice
    for our neighbours and God’s Creation

If you have an article, picture or event that you would like posted on the
Manitou Conference website, please contact Susan Whitehead, Office Coordinator
