                                             [bnr45]
                     
                                   Is any among you afflicted?
                                          let him pray.
                                          Is any merry?
                                      let him sing psalms.
                                     Is any sick among you?
                           let him call for the elders of the church;
                                   and let them pray over him,
                         anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord:
                          And the prayer of faith shall save the sick,
                                and the Lord shall raise him up;
                                 and if he have committed sins,
                                   they shall be forgiven him.
                               Confess your faults one to another,
       [jop2]                       and pray one for another,
    [buttonHOME]                     that ye may be healed.
                         The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man
    [buttonREQU]                         availeth much.

                     I pray not that thou shouldest take them from the
