Welcome

Welcome to the Presbytery of New Hope. From Efland to the Outer Banks, spanning
27 counties, with 122 congregations representing 28,314 members, we are a
Mid-Council of the Presbyterian Church (USA) serving eastern North Carolina. We
are engaged in a new mission design that seeks to meet the needs and offer the
challenges for mission in our life together.

As we partner in ministry we seek to live out our mission: In response to God’s
call in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, we seek to enable
local congregations and the Presbytery as a whole, to function effectively as
the body of Christ by actively exploring, facilitating, equipping, and
establishing ministries with the covenant community and beyond.
