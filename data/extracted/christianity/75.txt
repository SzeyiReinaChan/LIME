Welcome

Thank you for visiting our website. PCC is a small, family church located in
northwest Chicagoland. We offer a blended worship service Sunday morning with
both contemorary and traditional music. We strive to be a loving, welcoming
church, that seeks to give God glory in all that we do. Childcare is available.
We gather for the Sunday School hour at 8:45am and we enjoy coffee and
discussions through the Bible. The main worship service begins at 10am and
usually ends before 11:30am. We offer opportunities each month for fellowship
and ministry.
