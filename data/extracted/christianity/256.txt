Providing Free Christian Music For Listeners Around The World

AllWorship.com is a not-for-profit Christian radio station on the Internet that
provides commercial-free worship music in four formats: contemporary worship,
praise & worship, Spanish worship, and instrumental worship. Christians in
faraway countries, who don't have access to a terrestrial station, can now
listen FREE to Christian worship music. The ministry picks up the tab for all
programming, streaming and music fees. We are a 501(c)3 corporation that exists
on donations to keep the web site and stations on the Internet.
God has truly blessed this ministry. Thanks for listening!
