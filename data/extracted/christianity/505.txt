you have seen him go into heaven." Acts 1 v 10
Dear visitor,
Welcome to this site. This is not a crank site but a site dedicated to
declaring the truth of what the
Bible says about the return of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

I truly believe that we are living in the ‘Last Days’ that Jesus spoke about
and that His coming is
very near.
It is my sincere desire that you will, as you look through this site, see your
need of knowing
Jesus as your Lord and Saviour.

The Bible clearly states that all people will be judged by God for the life
they have lived. It tells us
That we have all sinned -  “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of
God” (Romans
Chapter 3 verse 23).
The good news is that none of us are “too bad” to be saved from our sins - “For
God so loved
the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall
not
perish but have eternal life” (John Chapter 3 verse 16)
But in order to be saved from that sin we have to believe in and accept Jesus
Christ into our lives.
