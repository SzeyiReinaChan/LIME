Welcome Home

Anchor Baptist Church is an independent, Bible-believing, fundamental Baptist
church dedicated to impacting Anne Arundel County and the regions beyond with
the gospel of Jesus Christ. As a thriving, multi-cultural group of believers,
our heartbeat is to . . .


  • Introduce you to a loving Savior who desires to free you from sin.
  • Invite you into a loving church family that will encourage and strengthen
    each member in their faith.
  • Inspire you to develop a heart for God through dynamic, Biblical preaching
    and Christ-exalting music.
  • Instruct you in Biblical truth through various adult Bible classes, Sunday
    School programs, and other discipleship ministries.
  • Involve you in God's service through weekly ministry opportunities.


If you are looking for these Biblical goals in a church home, come and worship
with us this Sunday. You will find a warm welcome from our friendly church
family. We look forward to seeing you!
