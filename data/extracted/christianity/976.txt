I was at a little restaurant in Puyallup and two ladies were standing behind me
 in the restaurant and overheard me say, “I said I sure wish I could find some
 friends in this area that are my age that have the same interests.” One lady
tapped me on the shoulder and said, “Have you ever thought of joining Puyallup
                       Methodist church?” - Judy Heidal.

Freezing nights is a ministry that helps people who don’t have much or who have
other problems and that need assistance for nighttime places to sleep. A place
   that just has caring hands that can talk to them. That’s where I feel my
             calling has been and I just love it. - Ronnie Price.

I had always wanted to go to Africa. I just felt like God was calling me when I
       heard his draw and his call to serve my people. - Jill Poleskie.
