Welcome to First Baptist Church of Kenmore

[Grimaldi-S]
We believe that the purpose of the First Baptist Church Of Kenmore is first and
foremost to be witnesses of Christ here in Akron, and then to the uttermost
parts of the earth. We believe that the Great Commission is our Great Command.
We also believe that we must focus on the family, helping them to build on a
firm foundation, & preparing them for the task that our Lord has given us. It
is our intent to help each believer hear our Lord say at the judgment seat of
Christ… “Well done, thou good and faithful servant:” Mat. 25:21. For those who
do not know our Saviour Jesus Christ, we believe that it is our duty to preach
the Gospel so that they too will have a sure foundation. For those who have
received Christ, we want to help them discover the Scriptural building
materials that will build strong family relationships. We invite you to browse
our site and see the services provided for you and your family.
