              "Welcome To National Experience"
              
               National Ministries is the greater umbrella that covers three powerful
              ministries in Washington, D.C., the most important city in the world, our
              nation's capital. Imagine one organization where several thousand
              African-Americans, Anglos, Africans, Caucasians, Hispanics, Filipinos, Koreans
              and more than a dozen other ethnic groups join together to educate, train,
              worship and reach out to those living in the political center of the world.
              The motto of National Ministries is "Serving the Spiritual Needs of the
              Nation's Capital!" and, under the leadership of Bishop Stephen L. Lowery,
              these ministries are making a difference to the community through three
              entities:

                                         National Church of God 

                                     "One People Worshiping One God" 

                                   National Bible College and Seminary 

                           "Training men and women...as if souls depend on it"

                                       National Christian Academy 

                       "Preparing students for College, for Life and for Eternity"
