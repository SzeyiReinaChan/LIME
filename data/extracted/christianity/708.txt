Welcome - Peace and Blessings

Welcome - Peace and Blessings

Over a century ago, Fr. Paul Wattson, the founder of the Franciscan Friars of
the Atonement, was searching for a name for a new religious society. Opening
the scriptures at random, his eyes fell upon the eleventh verse of the fifth
chapter of St. Paul’s epistle to the Romans: “...we also joy in God, through
our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.” The last
word of the verse stood out with a vividness that was to him overwhelming
at-one-ment. And so, the Society had found its name.

Headquartered at Graymoor in Garrison, New York, the Franciscan Friars of the
Atonement are a Roman Catholic religious community with social, ecumenical, and
pastoral ministries in the United States, Canada, England, Italy, and Japan.

Since its inception in 1898, reconciliation through atonement—the unity of men
and women with God and with one another—has been the mission of the Friars’
work and ministries to people of every race, religion, and walk of life.
