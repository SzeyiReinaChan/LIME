Our Vision

Faith Presbyterian Church is a new and growing church located in the Indian
Land area of Lancaster County, SC. We are a Christian community founded on
God’s love as we encounter it in the person of Jesus. We are a part of a
connectional church in that God connects us with all Christian churches in our
trust in Jesus and, in particular, God connects us to all other Presbyterian
Church (USA) churches by a shared theology, form of government, mission and
commitment. We worship on Sunday mornings at the Indian Land Recreation Center,
a building with a bright blue roof located near Indian Land High School on
Highway 521 just south its intersection with Doby’s Bridge Road. We are located
literally minutes from Fort Mill, SC, Ballantyne (South Charlotte), NC and
Waxhaw, NC.
