WELCOME! 

This is Christ's church.  There is a place for you here.
We are a church that shares a living, daring confidence in God's grace.
Liberated by our faith, we embrace you as a whole person -- questions,
complexities and all.
We invite you to join us in doing God's work in Christ's name for the life
of the world.
SUNDAY MORNING WORSHIP 9:30 AM       FELLOWSHIP & LEARNING 10:45 AM
