            Like Glad, Rockapella, or Take 6, Rescue has chosen to let their
Album       voices be the instruments on The Difference. Also like the
Reviews     aforementioned groups, it becomes apparent midway through the
Movies      first song that serious vocal talent is required in abundance to
Concert     pull this off successfully.  Luckily, Rescue meets this
Reviews     requirement without a problem.

Top 10      The music is pretty much standard CCM fare, but the quality of
Resources   the vocals overshadows that, for the most part.  The title track
Contact     illustrates this, accompanied by Jason Overstreet and Steve
Us          Maxwell s vocal percussion, which reminds the listener of Bobby
            McFerrin:

                How did Daniel face the lions?
                 How did Moses part the sea?                                  
                 How did Noah build that ark,
                 What s wrong with me?

             Darkest Hour  is a plea from one who cannot hear God s voice or
            see His face, yet knows He is there.  It is a picture of the
            frustration anyone feels when they feel their prayers are
            falling on deaf ears.   So Subtly  reminds us that God is in the
            quiet places as well, not just in the public miracles we see 
            every day.

            In all, The Difference holds up well.  While not my style of
            choice, I enjoyed listening to it and the talents of the
            performers, who do this well.  Fans of Acapella or most adult
            contemporary music will enjoy this as well.
