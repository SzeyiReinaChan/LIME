 Worship
   Team     Prairie Hill Church is a community of people from all walks of life and diverse
Rehearsal   backgrounds who have come together as friends and family. The high-tech and
            highly mobile society we live in has left many people feeling disconnected,
            with few they can call true friends. Yet we all seek support and encouragement
            in our lives. 
  Sunday    We seek a place to fit in, and, 
Worship     Prairie Hill is just such a place.
