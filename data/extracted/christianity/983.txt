Our Church

fr-jerome-lavigne-21

Welcome to St. Peter’s RC Church!

When it comes to fulfilling the Son of God’s mandate prior to his ascension
back to the Father in Heaven – we don’t mess around: “Go out to all the world
and proclaim the Gospel to all of creation.” (Mark 16:15) As it is, ours is a
time when your children and grandchildren are growing up in an environment
where truth, morality, and even the existence of God is under attack and up for
personal reinterpretation.

When all is said and done, we are all trying to get home. While it’s a narrow
path that leads to the gateway of the Kingdom of Heaven, it’s also an
illuminated, peace filled existence for those who walk it in their home life,
work life, church life.

We at St. Peter’s, through the transcendence experienced within our liturgies,
the sacraments we bring to our seven schools, and the special events we feature
in our parish that nurture families along their faith journey, we are here to
serve and facilitate an encounter between your heart and the ever living God.

“All who are on the side of truth listen to my voice.” (John 18:37) At St.
Peter’s, truth is spoken in season and out of season. Join us and experience
the peace of Heaven on earth.

In Christ,

Fr. Jerome Lavigne
