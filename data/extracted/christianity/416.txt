Happy Christmas and Happy New Year!

Yes, that’s right, even though the shops have all their Christmas goods on sale
and you might’ve taken down your festive decorations, the Christmas
celebrations don’t officially draw to a close until the feast of the Baptism of
the Lord on Sunday 10^th January!

This New Year and new season in school brings with it some new exciting
opportunities for “The Hub” (the Corpus Christi student Chaplaincy group).

“The Hub” meets every Monday after school to explore the teachings of the
Catholic faith, to learn new ways to pray and to help provide opportunities and
resources for other students around school to do this too.

Courtesy of “The Hub”, each day in January, as part of Daily Collective
Worship, the Year 7 form classes have a message to unfold from “The Hub”. The
messages are words of advice, encouragement and of faith.

As well as the usual programme of events, “The Hub” students will be embarking
on a pilgrimage to Leeds Cathedral later in January. As part of the “Year of
Mercy” celebrations, we will be entering through “the Holy Door” and joining
others from around the diocese for Mass. Like any good pilgrimage, tasty food,
fun and building up friendships will be a part of the adventure!

Watch this space to find out more about “The Hub” and more about our Year of
Mercy pilgrimage!
