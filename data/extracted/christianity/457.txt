Thank you for visiting Christ Church web site. We are a non-denominational
Spirit Filled church, established in 1975 by our pastors George and Joyce
Dudley. The motto of our church is "A Lighthouse Of Hope For Hurting People."
Within these pages you will discover information about the purpose,vision and
beliefs of Christ Church.

If you decide to visit our church you will find a friendly,enthusiastic group
of believers who truly love God and love others. In fact, you will find it
difficult to leave the service without recieving a warm greeting and a caring
handshake.

In our services you will experience wonderful congregational singing (a mixture
of hymns and praise songs), inspiring music, Christ Church Choir, and an
anointed message from God's Word.

If you are planning on moving to the Little Rock area or if you live in the
vicinity of Little Rock, Mabelvale, Bauxite, Bryant, Benton or any of the
surrounding areas please visit Christ Church at 11800 Vimy Ridge Road,Little
Rock, AR. We will welcome you warmly.. 

[icon_bible] Numbers 2:34 (KJV)
And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses:
so they pitched by their standards, and so they set forward, every one after
their families, according to the house of their fathers.

[icon_daily] 


And he goeth up into a mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would: and they
came unto him.

And he ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send
them forth to preach,

And to have power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils:

And Simon he surnamed Peter;

And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he surnamed
them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:

And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the
son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite,

And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an house.
