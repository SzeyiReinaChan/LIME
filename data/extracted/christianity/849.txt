Welcome

A warm welcome to online information about the programs, missions and
ministries of First Presbyterian Church.  This church has been a beacon of
light and hope to this community and around the world since its beginning on
March 25, 1952.

We gather from north and south, and from east and west. Among us we share a
rich variety of church traditions. Together we desire to celebrate the love
of God for all people and seek to be committed followers of Christ.  We
demonstrate this commitment by the way we live, the choices we make, and the
work we do, seeking to be compassionate to our neighbors across the globe.
Come join us on this journey of life and faith. The church began with
fifty-two charter members and has grown to several hundred members and
affiliates. 

Programs here are for all ages beginning with those in the pre-school to
those who have reached their vintage years.  We have a variety of weekly
Bible studies, music programs, fellowship groups and other social programs. 
 
We welcome all in the Naples community to participate in the life of this
church trusting that all who come to share with us, will sense the presence
of God and will desire to strive for an ever growing faith in Jesus Christ.
 
We extend a cordial invitation to all who are seeking a more vital and
meaningful Christian life, to be a part of this family of believers in Jesus
Christ.
