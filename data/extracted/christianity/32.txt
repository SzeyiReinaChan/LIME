Students Bring Holiday Cheer to New Orleans Police

St. Mary’s Academy students shared their love and appreciation for the New
Orleans Police Department by showering 7th district officers with a bevy of
sweet treats including fresh cakes, cookies, candy and confectionery. The event
was coordinated by Nancy Lytle of the Lakeview Civic  Improvement Association
and Gulf Coast Bank after Hurricane Katrina in appreciation for their 3rd
district officers during the holiday season. It expanded in 2011 to all of the
Districts as a special gift of love and appreciation from students across the
New Orleans area.
