                 Pope Pius XII Council 5045 was chartered October 13, 1960, the
                 Rev Msgr. Robert P. Hupp being instrumental in the forming of the
                 council.  The council was one of the first in the United States
                 to be associated with just one parish.  The Pope Pius XII Council
                 works closely with the Christ the King Parish in Omaha, providing
                 funds for various projects, supporting school activities, the
                 members being active participants in their parish.
