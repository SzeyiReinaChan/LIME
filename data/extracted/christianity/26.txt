Apostolic Christian World Relief has integrated with Apostolic Christian
Mission Committee to form a new outreach organization called Apostolic
Christian HarvestCall.

All programs and projects previously run by World Relief are now managed by
HarvestCall. Any support, financial or otherwise, previously given to World
Relief should now be directed to HarvestCall.

Thanks for your ongoing prayers and support.
