Welcome!

Walnut Hills is a place to call home where all are welcomed, nourished
spiritually, and sent forth to serve.

Our Sunday worship is held at 9:30 a.m.

“Walnut Hills is a welcoming place. We welcome all… to grow in faith together,
and to serve the community and world. We have so many enthusiastic children and
youth ministry volunteers, I pray that we continue to invite more persons to be
a part of a wonderful church, so that we grow in numbers as well as in faith.”
– Deacon Diane Wassonrmnlogoweb

We belong to the Reconciling Ministries Network, which mobilizes United
Methodists of all sexual orientations and gender identities to transform our
church and world into the full expression of Christ’s inclusive love.”

We hope you’ll explore these pages to learn more about what we have to offer.
And of course, we welcome any questions you have!
