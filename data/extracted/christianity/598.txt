What would you say?

If you suddenly died and found yourself standing before God's Judgment Throne,

an obsolete concept. They say it doesn't matter what you believe... that "truth
is relative"... that all that matters is if you're a good person. Well... it

                             Welcome to Eternity!

                       If there is a Heaven and a Hell,
                    are you 100% sure you'll go to Heaven?
             Please! Don't leave this site unless and until you're
                    thoroughly and unmistakably convinced!
     Once you cross that threshhold into Eternity . . . it'll be too late!
