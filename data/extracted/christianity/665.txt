Welcome to the Camp Experience

Adventure begins here at High Point. Whether you are a young person coming for
a week of summer camp, or an adult attending a retreat or conference, High
Point Camp brings you the whole camp experience, from exciting activities to
quality spiritual training in a Christ-centered environment.

Located in the Welsh Mountains of southeastern Pennsylvania, High Point Camp is
only a short drive from New York City, Philadelphia, Washington DC, and the
historical environment of Lancaster County. This beautiful camp and retreat
center is nestled in 230 acres of our church campus. This camp was designed
with the goal of being able to build up believers in the faith and evangelize
the lost.

High Point Camp has offered quality Christian camping for over 50 years. At the
same time, High Point is a highlight for thousands of campers every year. It is
packed full of wholesome fun and recreation, with plenty of time for spiritual
growth and personal reflection during our retreats and seminars. Over 1,400
people attend camp each summer, and nearly 6,000 attend seminars and retreats
each year.
