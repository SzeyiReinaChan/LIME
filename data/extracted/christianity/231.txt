Emergence is a worldwide community of Christian Scientists, their families and
friends providing spiritual and educational support for lesbians, gay men,
bisexuals and transgendered people as they deal with homophobia and
heterosexism.

EI honors the integrity of individual growth through the leadership of Mary
Baker Eddy in her writings and by fellowship with similarly minded Christian
Scientists.

In Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures, Mary Baker Eddy writes, “
Emerge gently from matter into Spirit. Think not to thwart the spiritual
ultimate of all things, but come naturally into Spirit through better health
and morals and as the result of spiritual growth.” (p. 485) Emergence
International encourages this gentle emergence and provides a means to help the
“weary wanderer” find their way to freedom.

We have in place a number of ways to connect with us. Our members are committed
to the study and practice of Christian Science and are available to answer
questions about the Christian Scientist LBGT Community, or about Christian
Science itself. A member from our list of contacts in various cities around the
United States and the world will respond to all inquiries made through our
Contact page. We also maintain a list of Gay-friendly Christian Science
practitioners, teachers, and nurses.

Every year in October, we host a conference where papers and workshops on
relevant topics are presented in an atmosphere of loving support. Some cities
have organized local groups which meet weekly or bi-weekly throughout the year.
Here on our web site we have posted topical Articles and Testimonies on our
Articles page. And a chat line is open for members to exchange news, healings,
and metaphysical insights.

We hope you find something you’re looking for here on our web site. But if you
don’t, please feel free to contact us at any time.
