For the Glory of Christ!  Come worship with us!

 
 

 Welcome to the internet home of Linwood Baptist Church. Linwood Baptist is an
independent Baptist church that is focused on the cross.  Our only goal is
getting the good news of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ to as many people
as we possibly can before it is eternally too late.  We focus our time and
attention on local evangelism, as well as our world mission program.  Linwood
Baptist supports 31 missionaries in many different parts of the world. It is
our heart’s desire to be a lighthouse that shines a Beacon of Hope from
Lafayette, Georgia into a dark world.

Accept this as our personal invitation to you to visit us at Linwood Baptist.
We hope to see you soon.
