Saint Joseph is the greatest saint. Special instance to single people, because
his caste life; to married persons, as Chief  of the Sacred Family; to
consecrated and apostles, in his devotion to Jesus and Mary; to priests, in his
reverence for Christ; to workers since he was always a worker.
He is the patron saint of a good and sweet death, because he himself died in
the arms of Jesus and Mary.
St. Teresa of Avila wrote: " There is no occasion that I remember asking favors
from him and that he haven't provided them. It is amazing the many graces I
have received from God  by  the  intermediation  of  this  saint  mediator, the
dangers  to  soul  and  body from which he has delivered me. To other saints,
it seems,  the Lord has given the grace to help and succor in a special need;
but this  glorious saint, I have as personal experience, helps in all need and
distress, so wants our Lord give us a signal  that as He was subject to St.
Joseph in His earthly life, so He wants to grant him all his requests in
heaven".
The church dedicate St. Joseph two days in the year:  March 19th and  May 1st .
Also consecrate the whole month of March to him in special veneration.-

    [yellowc]   Consecration of Christian Families [yellowc]

                         to the Family of Nazareth

    Oh  gentle Jesus, our Redeemer, that chose  to spend most of your mortal life
    in humility and submission to Mary and Joseph in the humble house of Nazareth
    sanctifying the family order ..., receive benignly our family, consecrated from
    now on to you. Protect it, keep it safe, and help it  to follow your steps;
    give it the peace and harmony of christian charity, so in following the example
    of Your Family, we became one with You, the Father and the Holy Spirit and with
    the Celestial Family of Angels and Saints. Mary, loving Mother of Jesus and our
    Mother, intercede on our behalf so Your Son accept  our Consecration, and
    attain for us His divine blessing and graces. Oh Saint Joseph, holy guardian of
    Jesus and Mary, help us with your prayers in all our spiritual and temporal
    needs so we can praise Jesus, our Redeemer, eternally together  with  you and
    Mary, your beloved Wife.
                                                                              
    Amen.

    [c1]This small site has been made with scarce technical knowledge but with
    deep love and large religious fervor. It is dedicated to Saint Joseph    
    who was the figure of God Father on Earth. I  keenly wish this small
    memento bring anew in us the desire to revere and pray to the Church
    Universal Patron. If you have any suggestion, please, send it clicking on
    the preceding icon. This page was updated on November 7th, 2003.
