    and forty undergraduates, post graduates, senior members and visitors. The
    College is associated with the Anglican Church of Australia, but is freely

    College Life

    St Mark’s College provides a supportive and stimulating environment where
    students pursue their optimum academic achievement. While aiming at the
    pursuit of excellence in specific fields of study at university, the
    College also promotes amongst its members a love of learning, and a
    critical approach to issues.
    By providing an atmosphere in which students are accepted as mature and
    self-responsible, St Mark’s aims to make a student’s stay at College a fun,
    enjoyable, intellectual, and maturing experience.

    Events

    A former Dean of St Mark’s once said that “At university you get a degree –
    at St Mark’s you get an education”. Certainly we take academic achievement
    seriously here, and St Mark’s students consistently achieve high results in
    their exams. But there is a lot more to life at St Mark’s than study; this
    is a fun and vibrant community, which encourages students to participate in
    a plethora of activities. There are plenty of activities in which to
    involve yourself in, whether it is on the stage or sports field, in the
    spheres of music, drama, through outreach to the community, or just by
    coming along to any or all of the College events.

Testimonials

  • 
        Upon walking through the front gates of St Mark's College for the first
        time, I remember feeling overwhelmed by the daunting experience of
        adjusting to a completely different lifestyle, away from the comfort
        and support of family and friends. Yet, in departing College through
        those same gates any of my initial apprehension had long dissipated. In
        leaving a Markswoman, I was a noticeably different person.

        Trephina Gartley, 2011 - 2013

  • 
        St Mark's College was my home away from home. It is a place that makes
        you feel welcomed, accepted, and encourages those who stay here to
        strive for the best in all areas of our lives; academically,
        athletically, creatively, and socially. By living at College you learn
        important life lessons every day, such as knowing how to balance work,
        sport, and fun, or just when you should knuckle down and study rather
        than watch another episode of your favourite television show. One thing
        I have gained by being on the College Club Committee is a love for the
        community at St Mark's. I'm proud to call myself a Marksman. Every
        moment I have spent here at St Mark's, I will never forget. I've
        created lifelong memories, and friends.

        Ben Whittaker, 2011 - 2014

  • 
        Ever since making the decision to live at St Mark's College I have
        never looked back. The experience has provided me with a home where I
        feel confident, happy and loved. I honestly couldn't think of a better
        way to go through university. It allowed me to immerse myself in my
        studies whilst grow lifelong friendships with people from all around
        Australia and the world, as well as participate in sport and maintain a
        part time job. I learnt how to balance so many aspects of life and I
        truly do put it down to the values encouraged at Mark's and the
        supportive people that surround me.

        Julia Graham, 2011 - 2012

 
St Mark’s was the first College to be established in Adelaide – our grounds are
beautiful and College life is rich with activities. We welcome you to take a
virtual tour and encourage you to come and see it for yourself.
