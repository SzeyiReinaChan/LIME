Statement of Faith

statementThe Greenville Church of Christ is a community of believers being
changed by God so that our daily lives reflect Jesus to those around us.

We desire to please our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, who said: “By this
everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another” (John
13:35). Our goal is to be more and more like Him. We commit to love like He
loves, not only our church family, but also all those around us who are lost
and hurting.

We believe in the divine inspiration of scripture and its relevance to life
today. Therefore, we remain diligent in study and application. Through Bible
study, worship, supportive relationships and service to others we strive to
make disciples of all God’s children.

We believe Jesus is the Son of God, who lived on Earth and shed His blood to
cleanse us from our sins. Jesus was raised from the dead and, through baptism,
gives us new life. The Holy Spirit lives in us and guides, teaches, and
inspires us to live out God’s purposes for our lives in Christ.

We believe in the importance of being involved with a local church which loves,
shares, and builds each other up. We relate with one another in honesty,
openness, and love as we encourage each other to use our God-given talents in
His service.
