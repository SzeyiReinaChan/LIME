Faith and reason are in a fight and faith is losing.

Why has the traditional, authority-based way of doing faith collapsed?
Catholics no longer have a unified understanding of what to believe, how to
act, or how to worship. If ex-Catholics were a religious denomination, they
would be the third-largest in the U.S. Only fifteen percent of young Catholics
attend church regularly. The young, the quizzical, the semi-faithful, the
somewhat churched, the unchurched, the agnostic, and the fallen away no longer
look to faith for credible insight into how they should live their lives.

Why is there such massive indifference to faith? And why, for those who
continue to participate, is there such fragmentation of identity, with splits
across the progressive/conservative divide and splits across time, between the
pre-conciliar Church and the post-conciliar Church?

In her illustrated personal essay, author Jeanne Follman explores why faith is
in such trouble today as she tells the story, and the backstory, of the fifty
years since Vatican II, and challenges us to reclaim the experience of the
sacred and modernize Church governance.
