His Passion Our Purpose

God created each one of us, loves each one of us, and wants us all to grow into
a deeper relationship with him.  He demonstrated that love and desire by
sending his son Jesus, who voluntarily came to live as one of us and display
what real grace and truth look like.  Here at East Point, our goal is to follow
the example of Jesus, so we make his passion our purpose.  This website is our
attempt to highlight who we are and help people connect to God’s great mission
here in the greater Wichita community.  If you would like more information than
what you find here, please contact us through the link above.  God bless.
