Episcopal - Anglican Worship in Pasadena

Join Us 

 

 

[greeting]Each Sunday our parish community gathers to make present and
celebrate the great and saving deed by which Christ has forever conquered sin
and death. We hope that you will be deeply touched by what happens here. Even
though you find yourself among people you may not yet know, we want you to feel
at home. We hope that through your experience of both our liturgy and
community, you will know yourself to be affirmed, forgiven, and loved.

About Church of the Angels

[COAExterio]The Church of the Angels, located in Pasadena, California, is one
of the most beautiful historic churches in the western United States. It was
built by Mrs. Alexander Robert Campbell Johnston in 1889 as a memorial to her
husband and as a place of worship for the people of the village of Garvanza.
