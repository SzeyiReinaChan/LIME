Kilglass Church of Ireland church is located about one mile on the Easkey side
of Enniscrone,County Sligo - overlooking Killala Bay. The church serves an
active local congregation and cordially invites all visitors to its services.
We use the Alternative Prayer Book in conjunction with the New Church Hymnal.
The congregation takes joy in singing the canticles and psalms so those blessed
with a good voice are especially welcome!

      We had another successful series of holiday art classes over the Summer

The latest addition to the centre is a fine sculpture by local artists Imelda
Peppard and Killian Rodgers. The group of figures represent a gathering of
learned people of the Bardic tradition and is entitled "Éigse". Nearby is a
tree planted by our friends from South Belfast with whom we have exchanged many
visits.

                          [kilglasslogo]  [ceremony]

  Our new Logo based on the work of local Sculptor Killian Rodgers seen here
at the wild, wet and windy ribbon cutting ceremony!  The ceremony was performed
    by local historian Gertie MacHale and Ken Sproule on 24th August, 2001.

There has  been a strong musical emphasis since the MacFirbis Centre opened and
Ivan Gibson continues to work with young musicians and bands helping them to
develop their potential through the recording technology available at the
centre.

The Mothers Union members met once a month from September. Activities included 
a Health talk on Osteoarthritis, Blood pressure and insomnia, a pot luck supper
held in the MacFirbis centre when funds were raised towards overseas projects,
knitting bonnets for premature babies, making up Christmas baskets.There are 3
million members worldwide lobbying against social inequalities and involved in
projects ranging from small scale agricultural initiatives to setting up family
support groups in prisons and supporting families affected by AIDS.Thanks to
Sue Fair and Dawn Gawley for all their hard work.

Our Ongoing History and Development
 
The Church at Kilglass was built in 1829 with a grant of nine hundred pounds
from the Board of First Fruits and is one of a series of charming churches
gracing the coast-line, all with a similar design. The interior was reordered
and extensively renovated in 1996. The church and congregation as well as other
members of the community have been involved with Cross-border initiatives
sponsored by Peace and Reconciliation. In 2001 this involved, under the
guidance of Ruth Greer (Tel.096/36433), a group of 18 women both local and from
Belfast, in completing 163 feet of tapestry including pew runners, Communion
rail kneelers and a pulpit falls. This is a farming and tourism area with a few
fishermen still plying their trade out of Enniscrone and the choice of the boat
and lamb reflect this background. These projects are part of our witness and
outreach in the community .

We pray for continued renewal and reconciliation in our community.
 
 

We are delighted to welcome Doctor Sue Patterson from New Zealand as our new
rector and as Dean of Killala( the first lady dean of a Cathedral in Ireland ).
Reverend Sue, as she wishes to be known, is a Fulbright Scholar and has written
on such issues as The task of Theology today, The Theology of Reconciliation,
Biblical and Systematic theology. She is also an artist and musician. We
welcome her husband John who is a psychologist.

Events


Exchanges continue with the South Belfast Cultural Society. Congratulations to
all who were involved in the St.Patricks Day parade in Sligo where they were
awarded first prize in the community section. A cultural evening was then held
in Enniscrone. Without the energy and committment of Chris and Paddy Tuffy and
John Deane these exchanges over 3 years would have faltered and failed. It is
impossible to put a value on the cultural benefit of these exchanges. The next
exchange in a fortnights time is to Portrush. Chris can be contacted at
tel.no.096/36938.
