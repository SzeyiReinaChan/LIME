Welcome

Welcome to Kendal Parish Church, a beautiful place where people have
encountered God’s love in Jesus for a over a thousand years. We are a community
of ordinary people on a journey together – people like everyone else,
experiencing the joys and pressures of life today as we try to live out our
Christian faith in the 21st century.

Every Sunday, you will find a rich variety of worship here – from the beauty
and rich tradition of Anglican liturgy and music to the informality of our
‘Gathering’ service.

It’s not all about Sunday services, though, and we hope you’ll come and see
more of what we do as a church from Monday to Saturday.

Whatever your reason for coming here – whether you are in need of help;
searching for a church; looking forward to your wedding or christening;
exploring faith or simply planning to visit the area – please come and see us
soon. We would love to meet you.

Services

 

Service Times

We would love you to come and join us as we worship God together and see how
Christian faith makes a difference in everyday life. We share a broad range of
services, from modern and informal worship to the beauty of the Anglican
tradition. You should be able to find a time and place with us where you can
‘feel at home’.

 

Christenings

Christenings, or Baptisms, are a wonderful occasion where you can celebrate the
arrival of your child. But they are not just for babies. We are very happy to
baptise adults who want to become part of God’s family.

 

Weddings

A wedding is one of life’s most wonderful moments: a time of love, commitment
and solemn promise as well as a party. Kendal Parish Church’s magnificent
interior and scenic surroundings  provide the perfect venue for your wedding.

Who is Jesus?

Jesus never went further than 200 miles from where He was born. He never wrote
a book or held a political or military position. We don’t even know what he
looked like. Yet He has had a greater effect on the lives of men and women than
any other figure in history.

Let Us Pray

Wanting to pray is the beginning of a relationship with God that can grow and
grow. Praying can be woven into everyday life. Prayer is not just something
done in church. It is about praying with others, praying alone, at any time and
any place. It is living life in a relationship with God.

Faith Journeys

Being a Christian isn’t about coming to church on Sunday. It’s about a real
life lived each day in relationship with God. Here are some stories of
different people’s experiences of faith in Jesus.

    Music Group

    The music group mostly plays at the 11am Gathering service, combining

    The first organ appears to have been in use during the early part of the
    17th century and was on a gallery at the West end.

    Many organisations organise concerts and other events here. Please contact
    us to discuss your event.

History

 

History

Kendal Parish Church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, is one of the widest
parish churches in the country and dates from the early thirteenth century,
though it occupies the site of a much earlier Church. A record in the Domesday
Book, and the shaft of an Anglian Cross, housed in the Parr Chapel and dated at
approximately AD 850, suggest that Christians have worshipped here for over a
thousand years.

many tourists and we are glad to welcome thousands of visitors each year to
Kendal Parish Church. Everyone who comes is impressed and inspired by the
building’s beauty and by our long history of Christian worship. We hope that
