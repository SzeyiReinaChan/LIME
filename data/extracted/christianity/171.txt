 [etching]        Writings on Christian Nonresistance and Pacifism from
Anabaptist-Mennonite Sources

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Nonresistance is a central practice for the Anabaptist heritage of Christian
witness and discipleship.  At this location, there are links to writings by
Anabaptist-Mennonite writers on the subject of nonresistance which are
currently available on the World Wide Web. These writings exhibit a range of
perspectives among Mennonites: from conservative dualism between church and
state to activist antagonism toward state-sponsored violence. Numerous
denominations of Mennonites are represented here. While the texts below are
limited to the themes of nonresistance and pacifism, the most recent systematic
expression of faith for Mennonite Church USA is Confession of Faith in a
Mennonite Perspective.
