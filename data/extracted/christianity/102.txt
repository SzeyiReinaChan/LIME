What to expect

What to expect


9:30am & 11am Sunday Worship

Walking in the doors of a new Church can be intimidating.  

We know this and work hard to make your experience great.

When you visit First Baptist Church you can expect a warm welcome from one of
our volunteers and an even warmer cup of coffee from our coffee bar.  Kids can
be checked in for nursery or children's church before service begins, and you
can take one of our nursery pagers or enable SMS alerts to your phone though
KidCheck so we can let you know discreetly if your child needs attention.

Music

We have two services each week that each highlight two wonderful, but different
styles of music.

 

9:30am Worship Service

Our 9:30 service uses classic Hymns sung from our hymnals.  We sing 4-5 songs
each sunday accompanied by organ or piano.  This service also features special
music from our vocal choir, handbell choir and talented musicians of the
church.   

 

11:00am Worship Service

Our 11:00am service uses a full band with current praise and worship music.  We
usually sing around 6 songs every sunday with communion served directly before
the sermon. 

Sermons

The preaching at FBC is biblically based and culturally relevant.  Plan on
sermons lasting around 30 minutes.  We record all of our sermons to share with
you online, so please feel free to listen to them here.

Sermon Audio

If you have any more questions, we would love to hear from you.
