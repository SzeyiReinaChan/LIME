                 The Evidence, Faith For Today Television’s production hosted
                 by Dwight Nelson, Senior Pastor of the Pioneer Memorial Church
                 at Andrews University, Berrien Springs, Michigan, brings a
                 brand new opportunity to connect with friends and neighbors
                 who need to re-ignite their enthusiasm about things spiritual,
                 or to simply introduce them to a God who cares about every
                 facet of their lives.

                 The Evidence is a half-hour news-magazine television show that
[dwightnelson]   investigates the possibility of God in all expressions.
                 Through interviews with world-renown scientists who de-mystify
                 the technologies of nature, and artists who illuminate the
                 wonder of life, The Evidence bridges the gap between science
  • About Us     and theology, between ritual and the human heart. It asserts
  • Episodes     that the idea of God, while not provable, is not irrational.
  • Station      Almost an introduction to God,The Evidence explores such
    Guide        fundamental questions as “Does God really exist?,” “Where did
                 we come from?” and “Why are we here?” Studying not only the
                 idea that God exists, but that amazing transforming power of
                 spirituality in the lives of everyday people.

                 Dr. Nelson takes us on a weekly reconnaissance tracing
                 evidence of God through the world’s cultures throughout
                 history, virtually re-booting our spiritual consciousness with
                 his fresh Judeo-Christian awareness replacing ambivalence with
                 revitalized understanding and enthusiasm.
