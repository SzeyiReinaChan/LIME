Many Are Called
At the time of the death of Mr. Herbert W. Armstrong, January 16, 1986, the
Worldwide Church of God numbered approximately 113,000, men, women and
children.

The questions beg   Where are all those large numbers today? Why did they
leave? Where did they go? Where are they today?

New Release
The Three Elijahs
Because of their unwillingness to recognize the truth of the end-time Elijah
being Mr. Herbert W. Armstrong, they have not only rejected him, but in so
doing they have also rejected some to all of the true doctrinal teachings that
Jesus used him to RESTORE within His Church and have replaced them with the 
Pagan teachings of the Catholic and Protestant Churches.

                                                  Healing Today In God's Church
   "Is any sick among you? Let him call for the elders of the Church; and let
them PRAY over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord: and the
prayer of FAITH shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he
have committed sins, they shall be forgiven him." (James 5:14-15).
                           For The Christian TODAY!

After the New Testament Church was started, the apostles and evangelists
continued to HEAL THE SICK as well as preach the gospel!

Almost immediately after the Day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came, Peter
and John, in the name of Jesus Christ, healed the cripple, lame from birth. (
Acts 3:1-11). As a result, they were thrown into prison, but after they were
released they met with the other disciples and prayed earnestly to God, saying:
"And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that
with all boldness they may speak thy word, by stretching forth thine hand to
HEAL." "And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were
assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they
spake the Word of God with boldness," (Acts 4:29-31).

Afterward so many were healed, that even Peter's shadow passing over the sick
resulted in their healing, THRU GOD'S POWER. (Acts 5:15). Those who came to
these ministers of Christ, for healing by PRAYER to GOD, "were HEALED, every
one." (Acts 5:16).

Philip went down to Samaria, and the sick were HEALED! (Acts 8:5-7). Thru
Paul's ministry, God healed the sick. The demand on his time became so great,
and many at a distance whom Paul was unable to visit, wanted healing, and so
God honored a SPECIAL MEANS -- Paul anointed and prayed over pieces of cloth --
handkerchiefs and aprons -- and sent them to these requesting prayer for
healing, and THEY WERE HEALED! (Read of it in Acts 19:11-12).

Now God is the SAME today -- and hundreds today are being healed by that very
method, given to us in the word of God! In my office we hold a daily prayer
service. All letters requesting special prayer are brought in, and members of
my staff join me in interceding with God for each one. All who ask prayer for
HEALING are given special consideration and prayer. And, since it is impossible
for me to visit each of these in their own homes, I anoint a handkerchief in
each case, following the Apostle Paul's example, and this is mailed to the one
who is sick.

Contact Mr. Billingsley today and ask to be put on the Church's Prayer Request
List and receive your anointed cloth.

                             The Ezekiel WATCHMAN

[banner_hwa]
                      God's Watchman/The Ezekiel Warning

In reference to taking the Gospel and the Ezekiel Warning Message to Israel and
the world, (John 4:38; Matthew 24:14: Ezekiel 33:1-11), Jesus Christ said the
night is soon coming when no one can work (John 9:4) . Realizing its closeness
there is a great need to reach out with a loving and caring hand with this
responsibility before it comes to be too late.
There is a great and vital need to be in the faithful Church Jesus Christ is
now using in this end-time as a conduit or instrument to support His continued
Work Via the Recorded Works of His late apostle on our websites. Revelation
3:7-13; Matthew 24:45-47. They also provide food for God's scattered people.

Please know by making the needed move to become an active member and
participating in God's work could result in not having to experience the Great
Tribulation and the possible loss of life!

Scripture reveals there will only be a FEW who will have heeded the WARNINGS
and be blessed by God. Will YOU be of the Few, or of the majority who refuse to
listen to our loving and caring God, who WARNS:
"Also I set WATCHMEN over you, saying, 'Listen to the sound of the Trumpet!'
But they said, 'We will NOT listen' (Jeremiah 6:17). As to Why " ...You have
forsaken the LORD your God and the FEAR of Me is NOT in you," says the LORD God
of hosts (Jeremiah 2:19).

Most sincerely and lovingly, I ask: where will you and I be when disaster
suddenly sprmgs upon the Church and Israel as a snare? Please know - unless we
are vigilantly watching, praying, and enduring faithfully, while clinging to
the TRUTH once delivered to the saints and restored by God's promised Elijah,
we could be caught up in it and our cry to God would then be too late (Malachi
4:4-6; Jude 3-4; Luke 21:34-36; Revelation 3:8,10).

We MUST be preparing ourselves Spiritually NOW   while there is yet some
remaining daylight, not trusting in ourselves, the military, or any one, but
only in the true and wonderful caring God in heaven above.

Since prophecy reveals where we now are in time, it is all the more essential
to keep in mind what God has made known through His Prophet:

 . . . The end has come it has DAWNED for you; Behold it has come! . . . a day
of trouble is near . . . Now upon you, I will soon pour out My fury . . . So
you, son of man: I have made you A WATCHMAN for the house of Israel; therefore
you shall hear a word from My mouth and WARN them for Me  (Ezekiel 7:6-8;
33:7).

Are we listening-are we involved in warning the Church Members who have strayed
off-track, and Israel! Are we making the needed preparations, NOW! Tomorrow may
be too late!

[sabbath_central_header_text_thumb]
                      Which day is the Christian Sabbath?

Jesus, teaching as part of His Gospel how to observe the Sabbath said: "The
sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath: Therefore the Son of man
is Lord also of the sabbath" (Mark 2:27-28).
In 1926 Mrs. Loma Armstrong came to the knowledge of God's Sabbath, this led to
Mr. Herbert W. Armstrong involving himself in intensive study to determine what
day was actually the Christian Sabbath.

God intended the Sabbath to be a BLESSING for mankind -- not a CURSE! And Jesus
showed us by His living example, in principle, and by direct teaching, exactly
HOW the Sabbath is to be kept so it can be a GREAT JOY and BLESSING to us all!

Teaching the Sabbath with love, bringing God's children to love the Sabbath is
one of the goals of this website.

The 4th Commandment commands God s people to rest from physical labor and
pursuits and be spiritually rejuvenated by assembling together with other
members to worship God wherever possible as also commanded by God through the
apostle Paul (Exodus 20:8-11; Hebrews 10:25). It is to be observed from sunset
to sunset on the 7th day of the week (Leviticus 23:32).

The truth about God's Sabbath transcends national and ethnic borders worldwide.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
God s basic spiritual Law which regulates human life existed from creation. It
is  holy, just and good,  said Paul in Romans 7:12-14. This Law is summed up in
the Ten Commandments God gave to Moses on Mt. Sinai. The Ten Commandments were
not new - only the written, codified form in which God spoke and wrote them was
new.

   Jesus said,  Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I
am not come to destroy, but to fulfill  (Matt. 5:17). God s Church believes
David. It also believes Jesus. It does what He commands. He is, after all, the
Head of the Church of God! Other Laws Based on Ten Commandments Abraham kept
the ten Commandments. He also kept God s STATUTES and LAWS.

   The CHURCH was planned to be God s instrumentality for calling predestinated
human beings out of this world to be trained for positions of leadership in the
world tomorrow, when they will teach and train others. That is why in the New
Testament, the Church is called the firstfruits of God s salvation.

   All this necessitated certain vital steps one at a time in the procedure of
God s supreme master plan!

   In addition to the Ten Commandments of God, His people are to be learning
the statutes and judgments of God as well. In the millennium all will be taught
to Israel and the Gentile nations by Jesus Christ and aided by His Bride.

   Since we are to teach them, as well as to answer questions in this age about
them, one should know there are differences between the statutes that are to be
learned and obeyed by God s people in this age, apart from others that are not
to be obeyed now except in principle, such as the sacrificial and ceremonial
laws.

   Though many realize from Scripture these laws will once again be practiced
in the beginning of the millennium very few understand why (Ezekiel, chapters
40-44-48). 

   This first writing with the attachment will lay the groundwork for the
others to follow that should enable the reader to begin understanding the laws
that are to be obeyed in this age.
