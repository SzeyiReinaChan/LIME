Gospel or Gimmickry


Sewell Hall

[Bible]

    "Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke,
    exhort, with great patience and instruction. For the time will come when
    they will not endure sound doctrine; but wanting to have their ears
    tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to
    their own desires, and will turn away their ears from the truth and will
    turn aside to fables" (2 Tim. 4:2-4).

These verses clearly indicate that there are times when gospel preaching is in
season and out of season. History indicates the same. In the first century in
most places it was in season; in the middle ages it was out of season. There
was a thrilling season for the gospel in middle America in the early nineteenth
century, while at the same time it was largely out of season in France and
Europe.

In our own lifetime, we have seen the same situation change. This writer
remembers days in Chattanooga when non-Christians attended meetings in large
numbers for no other reason than to hear the gospel, and ten or twenty baptisms
were not uncommon in such a meeting. Simple gospel preaching does not now seem
to have such drawing power.

What are we to do when gospel preaching is out of season; when people are more
interested in education, entertainment, recreation, and social activities than
they are in preaching; when the wisdom of the world has more appeal than the
wisdom of God?

COMMON ANSWERS:

"You have to take people where they are," we are told. "We have to give them
what they want to attract attention. Then we can reach them with the gospel."
On this basis, all kinds of gimmicks are used to entice the worldly. Many
churches have turned into little more than community centers and social clubs.
They are more involved with ball teams and scout troops than with Bible
teaching. The highways are crowded with their buses taking various age groups
to every kind of amusement area in the country from Disney World to Lake
Wannepesauka. Their advertising reads for all the world like a circus flyer,
offering prizes, free gifts, and fun. Often, no promise is made of anything
spiritual at all.

Others realizing that the gospel "is the power of God unto salvation" limit
their activities more to preaching. But even here, appeal is still to the
worldly tastes of our generation. If possible, preachers are obtained who have
made a big reputation in sports, in entertainment, or in government. Otherwise,
great emphasis is given in advertising to the educational attainments of the
speaker or to his gifts as a "dynamic, powerful, eloquent" speaker.

GOD'S WAY.

The problems of disinterested people is not new. It existed in some places even
in the first century. Paul said it existed in Corinth. "For indeed Jews ask for
signs and Greeks search for wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a
stumbling block and to Gentiles foolishness" (1 Cor. 1:22,23).

Paul had the power to offer signs to the Jews and the knowledge to compete with
the Greeks in worldly wisdom. The philosophy described above would have
suggested advertisement of a lecture on "The Judaistic Philosophy in the Roman
World." Obtaining his audience with this, he could then slip in a little about
Jesus and the cross. But this was not Paul's approach, as he told us: "For I
determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified" (1
Cor. 2:2). Human philosophy and human wisdom had no place in Paul's plan for
saving the lost in Corinth.

Preaching only the gospel, of course, Paul could have announced himself as "Dr.
Paul, graduate of the University of Gamaliel, noted author, world traveler,
inspired and dynamic lecturer." Rather, he says, "And when I came to you,
brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming
to you the testimony of God...I was with you in weakness adn in fear and in
much trembling, and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of
wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith
would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God" (1 Cor. 2:1,3-5).

Worldly appeals simply cannot save lost men. And to attach them to the gospel
is to cheapen the good news of Jesus Christ. By such appeals we may increase
numbers and even "make waves," but such individuals in the local church are
liabilities rather than assets. As materials in God's building they are
classified as "wood, hay, and straw." Paul warns agains building such material
into the church: "According to the grace of God which was given to me, like a
wise builder I laid a foundation, and another is building on it. But each man
must be careful how he builds on it...Now if any man builds on the foundation
with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each man's work will
become evident; for the day will show it because it is to be revealed with
fire, and the fire itself will test the quality of eah man's work" (1 Cor. 3:
10,12,13).
