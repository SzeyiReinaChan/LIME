Welcome to restoration family church

Loving God More, Loving People More, Loving More People

Join us Sunday!  11AM

Restoration Family Church is a community of faith and friendship with people
from just about every background. People young and old, singles and families,
newcomers and old timers have all found RFC is their place to believe and
belong. Our Sunday services are a time of excitement and celebration as our
worship team leads us in singing songs that are uplifting and as we strive to
teach God's Word in a way that is practical to daily life.



Where are you located?



We are located at 10201 Jerry Dunn Pkwy in Benbrook, TX 76126. South off I20 at
the intersection of Highway 377 and RM 2817. 



What Should I wear?


We know you might be worried about wearing the right thing when you come to
church; we invite you to come as you are. Whether you are more comfortable in
jeans and a t-shirt, polo and khakis, or a suit and tie, you'll fit right in.
