Welcome to Indian Nations Presbytery! We provide nurture and support for 49
congregations located in central and southwest Oklahoma. INP includes more than
10,000 men, women, and children seeking to serve God, church, and community
together. There are two other presbyteries in Oklahoma: Eastern Oklahoma and
Cimarron. Indian Nations Presbytery works with the Synod of the Sun in the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).
