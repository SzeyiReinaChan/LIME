Have You Ever Been Alone With God? (2)

When He was alone the twelve…asked of Him… — Mark 4:10

His Solitude with Us. When God gets us alone by affliction, heartbreak, or
temptation, by disappointment, sickness, or by thwarted affection, by a broken
friendship, or by a new friendship — when He gets us absolutely alone, and we
are dumbfounded and cannot ask one question, then He begins to expound. Watch
Jesus Christ’s training of the twelve. It was the disciples, not the crowd
outside, who were perplexed. They constantly asked Him questions, and He
constantly expounded things to them; but they only understood after they had
received the Holy Spirit (see John 14:26).

If you are going on with God, the only thing that is clear to you, and the only
thing God intends to be clear, is the way He deals with your own soul. Your
brother’s sorrows and perplexities are an absolute confusion to you. We imagine
we understand where the other person is, until God gives us a dose of the
plague of our own hearts. There are whole tracts of stubbornness and ignorance
to be revealed by the Holy Spirit in each one of us, and it can only be done
when Jesus gets us alone. Are we alone with Him now, or are we taken up with
little fussy notions, fussy comradeships in God’s service, fussy ideas about
our bodies? Jesus can expound nothing until we get through all the noisy
questions of the head and are alone with Him.

Wisdom From Oswald Chambers

We are all based on a conception of importance, either our own importance, or
the importance of someone else; Jesus tells us to go and teach based on the
revelation of His importance. “All power is given unto Me.… Go ye therefore
….”  So Send I You, 1325 R
