[Church]

Welcome to our website. We are an independent Baptist church located in the
community of China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station in Ridgecrest, California.

We have adopted the theme "A Going Church For A Coming Savior" to reflect our
desire to fulfill the Great Commission of our Lord Jesus Christ, not only in
our local community, but around the world!

Come and join us at 10:00 AM each Sunday morning as we Retrace the Faith Filled
Steps of Bible Characters. 

We are also studying the Book of 1st Corinthians in our Wednesday evening Bible
Study at 6:00 PM.

Please take some time and look around our website.  We hope you will have the
opportunity to visit with us in person!  We are located next to the old
Albertsons and Miso restaurant.
