Rio Texas Annual Conference

The United Methodists of The Rio Texas Conference are focused on reaching out
to the people of South Texas. Some of our churches are located in some of the
fastest-growing areas of the country. Others are located in areas where people
are struggling with issues of poverty, lack of affordable housing, and a loss
of hope. We are committed to providing vital missions, vital congregations, and
strong leaders to connect our churches to the people.  

Our mission field spans South Texas. Our churches are in large cities and small
towns from Austin to McAllen, from San Angelo to Victoria in vibrant cities,
historic small towns and struggling communities.
