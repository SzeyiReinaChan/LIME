HOW YOU CAN HELP

pres-homepage-script

Pres is the Catholic high school with the longest history in Louisville––and a
future that’s wildly promising. It’s the downtown school, full of character and
personality, just like the girls who go here.

It’s where art emerges, knowledge rises, cultures combine, and bonds form. It’s
where real life unfolds, amazing happens, and the future grows big before your
very eyes.

Pres is where you’ll learn, love, believe, and be the you that you want to be. 
And it’s where you belong.
