 A welcome from our pastor...
 

     Otterbein United Methodist Church exists for the purpose of helping to
spread the Good News that God has sent his son, Jesus Christ, to redeem the
whole world.
     We will help persons become disciples of Christ, help them grow in their
understanding of God to the end that they might respond in all things in love
and faith.
     We will help persons live in the Spirit of God and, both as individuals
and as part of the Body of Christ, respond as true disciples to the needs of
our community and the whole world.
