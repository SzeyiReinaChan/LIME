Welcome to Inverness Christian Fellowship Website

[view-over-inverness-300x225]

We are a growing, vibrant and contemporary church set in the beautiful city of
Inverness.

At ICF we believe that people matter to God.  God has an amazing plan for your
life and it is a plan that starts with you coming into relationship with Him
through Jesus Christ.  Knowing and living for God is life as it is meant to be
lived; life as God intended.

At ICF we want people to discover this new life for themselves and live in the
power of God working in their lives.

    “So in Christ Jesus you are all children of God through faith, for all of

    and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”
