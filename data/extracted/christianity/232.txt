                                       Now then, bye and bye, as it were for anger not for covetise, the       Queen Jane Seymour
                                       Protector sent into the house of Shore's wife (for her husband          Queen Anne of Cleves
                                       dwelled not with her) and spoiled her of all that she ever had,         Queen Catherine Howard
                                       above the value of two or three thousand marks, and sent her body to    Queen Katherine Parr
                                       prison. And when he had a while laid unto her for the manner's sake,
                                       that she went about to bewitch him, and that she was of counsel with    King Edward VI
                                       the Lord Chamberlain^2 to destroy him; in conclusion when that no       Queen Mary I
                                       color could fasten upon these matters, then he laid heinously to her    Queen Elizabeth I
                                       charge that thing that herself could not deny, that all the world       Henry Fitzroy, Duke of
                                       wist was true, and that natheles every man laughed at to hear it        Richmond
                                       then so suddenly so highly taken, that she was naught of her body.
                                       And for this cause (as a goodly continent prince clean and faultless    Renaissance English
                                       of himself, sent out of heaven into this vicious world for the          Writers
                                       amendment of men's manners) he caused the Bishop of London to put       Bishop John Fisher
                                       her to open penance, going before the cross in procession upon a        William Tyndale
                                       Sunday with a taper in her hand.^3 In which she went in countenance     Sir Thomas More
                                       and pace demure, so womanly, and albeit she were out of all array       John Heywood
                                       save her kirtle only, yet went she so fair and lovely, namely while     Thomas Sackville
                                       the wondering of the people cast a comely rud in her cheeks (of         Nicholas Udall
                                       which she before had most miss) that her great shame won her much       John Skelton
                                       praise among those that were more amorous of her body than curious      Sir Thomas Wyatt
                                       of her soul. And many good folk also that hated her living and glad     Henry Howard
                                       were to see sin corrected, yet pitied they more for her penance than    Hugh Latimer
                                       rejoiced therein when they considered that the Protector procured       Thomas Cranmer
                                       it, more of a corrupt intent than any virtuous affection.               Roger Ascham
                                                                                                               Sir Thomas Hoby
                                       This woman was born in London, worshipfully friended, honestly          John Foxe
                                       brought up, and very well married, saving somewhat too soon, her        George Gascoigne
                                       husband an honest citizen, young and goodly and of good substance.      John Lyly
                                       But forasmuch as they were coupled ere she were well ripe, she not      Thomas Nashe
                                       very fervently loved for whom she never longed. Which was haply^4       Sir Philip Sidney
                                       the thing that the more easily made her incline unto the King's         Edmund Spenser
                                       appetite when he required her. Howbeit that respect of his royalty,     Richard Hooker
                                       the hope of gay apparel, ease, pleasure, and other wanton wealth was    Robert Southwell
                                       able soon to pierce her soft tender heart. But when the king had        Robert Greene
                                       abused her, anon her husband (as he was an honest man and one that      George Peele
                                       could his good, not presuming to touch a King's concubine) left her     Thomas Kyd
                                       up to him altogether. When the king died, the Lord Chamberlain took     Edward de Vere
                                       her, which in the King's days, albeit he was sore enamored upon her,    Christopher Marlowe
                                       yet he forbare her, either for reverence or for a certain friendly      Anthony Munday
                                       faithfulness. Proper she was, and fair: nothing in her body that you    Sir Walter Ralegh
                                       would have changed, but if you would have wished her somewhat           Thomas Hariot
                                       higher. Thus say they that knew her in her youth. Albeit some that      Thomas Campion
                                       now see her (for yet she liveth) deem her never to have been well       Mary Sidney Herbert
                                       visaged. Whose judgment seemeth me somewhat like as though men          Sir John Davies
                                       should guess the beauty of one long before departed by her scalp        Samuel Daniel
                                       taken out of the charnel house; for now she is old, lean, withered      Michael Drayton
                                       and dried up, nothing left but rivelled skin and hard bone. And yet     Fulke Greville
                                       being even such, whoso well advise her visage might guess and devise    Emilia Lanyer
                                       which parts how filled might make it a fair face. Yet delighted men     William Shakespeare
                                       not so much in her beauty as in her pleasant behavior. For a proper
                                       wit had she, and could both read well and write, merry in company,
                                       ready and quick of answer, neither mute nor full of babble, sometime    Persons of Interest
                                       taunting without displeasure and not without disport.^5 The King        Cardinal Thomas Wolsey
                                       would say that he had three concubines, which in three divers           Archbishop Thomas
                                       properties diversly excelled: one the merriest, one the wiliest, and    Cranmer
                                       one the holiest harlot in his realm, as one whom no man could get       Thomas Cromwell
                                       out of the church lightly to any place but it were to his bed. The      John Fisher, Bishop of
                                       other two were somewhat greater personages, and natheles of their       Rochester
                                       humility content to be nameless and to forbear the praise of those      Cardinal Lorenzo
                                       properties. But the merriest was this Shore's wife, in whom the King    Campeggio
                                       therefore took special pleasure. For many he had, but her he loved,     Cardinal Reginald Pole
                                       whose favor, to say the truth (for sin it were to belie the devil),     Stephen Gardiner,
                                       she never abused to any man's hurt, but to many a man's comfort and     Bishop of Winchester
                                       relief. Where the King took displeasure, she would mitigate and         William Tyndale
                                       appease his mind. Where men were out of favor, she would bring them     Pico della Mirandola
                                       in his grace. For many that had highly offended, she attained           Desiderius Erasmus
                                       pardon. Of great forfeitures she gat men remission. And finally in      Christopher
                                       many weighty suits, she stood many men in great stead, either for       Saint-German
                                       none or very small rewards, and those rather gay than rich, either      Thomas Linacre
                                       for that she was content with the deed' self well done, or for that     William Grocyn
                                       she delighted to be sued unto and to show what she was able to do       Hugh Latimer
