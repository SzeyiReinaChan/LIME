"^3 We proclaim to you what we have seen and heard, so that you also may have
fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son,
Jesus Christ. ^4 We write this to make our joy complete.

^5 This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light;
in him there is no darkness at all."

1 John 1:3-5 - NIV
