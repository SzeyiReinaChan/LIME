Welcome

[CE-link-banner]

We are a diverse group of people coming from a wide rage of ages, backgrounds
and nationalities united through a common faith in Jesus. We come from in and
around the town of Carrigaline, which is located in County Cork, Ireland.
Through our shared desire to follow Jesus we look to help each other, not just
on Sundays but every day of the week!

A Place to Belong…

Church is the people not the building and church is like a family rather than a
collection of individuals. As a family we aim to care for, support and
encourage one another as we follow the example of Jesus.

What Matters Most…

The message of Jesus….is the most important message we have to offer. It’s
central to what we believe and is at the heart of what we do as a Church.

Finding Out More – Christianity Explored…

We’d like to invite you to find out more about Christianity. The Christianity
Explored course gives you time and space to think through who Jesus is and why
it matters.
