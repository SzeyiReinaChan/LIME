Welcome to the Episcopal Diocese of California

[portrait_b]

Since 1849, we have been a diocese filled with passionate, talented, committed
people — seekers, innovators, and people who serve. In our past 160 years,
Diocese of California Episcopalians have founded a hospital, hosted the first
Head Start program in the country, provided more supportive housing for the
homeless in San Francisco than any others, birthed Interfaith Power and Light,
pioneered the return of the Peace in the Eucharistic service, re-introduced the
Great Vigil of Easter into central liturgies of the Episcopal worship, and more
recently brought forth the modern Labyrinth Movement, and the practices of the
Open Table and Ashes to Go. 

A Christian community of some 27,000 Episcopalians covering most of the San
Francisco Bay Area and a large part of Silicon Valley, our diocese is focused
on becoming and being the Beloved Community, an evocative and mystery-filled
phrase popularized by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Fellowship of
Reconciliation. For over five years we have put a strong focus on revitalizing
the Church, and living into the values we associate with the Beloved Community,
such as embodied justice and rooted spirituality. To learn more about the
Beloved Community vision, click here.

— The Rt. Rev. Marc Handley Andrus
