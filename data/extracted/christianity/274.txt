          Hi, my name is Trisha and I would like to tell you a little
          bit about myself. The very first thing I need to say is that
          I'm a Christian and I sing with a Southern Gospel Group
          called the Stanley's. You can visit our site by clicking on  [trish3]
          our name or come talk to us on SG Chat.
          I am married to a wonderful man named Mike and have 2 great   Trisha
          children. A boy named Cody and a girl named Micah. They keep
          me on my toes :-)
          I will be adding pictures and information about the group
          and my family, so keep coming back to see what is here.
