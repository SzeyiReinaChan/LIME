Love. Live. Share.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WE CONTINUALLY ENCOURAGE our people to model the love of God, to minister to
one another with His love, and to multiply God’s unconditional love through
Jesus in our community. It is our desire that today you will experience this
love of God as you participate in our weekly celebration of life in Him. At
East Memorial, the Word of God is our textbook. Each message that you hear from
this pulpit is taken directly from the Bible. We encourage you to bring your
Bible so that you can see for yourself what God is saying.
