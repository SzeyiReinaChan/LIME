  • Join Us For Worship

    We practice a convergence style worship at Grace. We use a mix of
    traditional and contemporary styles to fit the theme each week.

    Join us Sundays at 10 am and Wednesdays at 6 pm to see what it's all about!

  • Volunteer Opportunities!

    Come and grow in faith through service to others!
    Volunteer opportunities abound at Grace, with everything from Worship
    Assistants, Education Leaders, and Wednesday Meal Teams to ministries
    outside our walls helping serve the Salvation Army, raising money for
    Habitat for Humanity, Working with Fair Trade, and more!
