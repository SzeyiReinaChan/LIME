We appreciate your online visit and hope that you will take a few minutes to
find out more about us. Here at Fairview Baptist Church you will find a place
where you can worship, serve, and learn in a relaxed, friendly atmosphere.

Salt Of The Earth Ministries: Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt
have lost his savior, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for
nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men. Mathew 5:13

 

For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever
believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. John 3:16 kjv
