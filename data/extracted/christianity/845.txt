Christian Beliefs are Founded on the Bible

We have some Bible based beliefs, central to who we are, that we would like to
share with you.  We stress the Bible as it is God’s inspired Word, where he
provides history, instruction and expectations for how we need to conform our
thoughts and actions to His will.

Website, Site History and Archives

This is the third iteration of the website for the congregation. The first
site, based on frontpage, was started in 1998.  As it became unwieldy to
maintain, the second set of frontpage based sites were created with separate
subsites. Those archives are still available through these links even though
frontpage is long gone:
