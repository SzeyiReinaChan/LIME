   The New Testament is our Creed, and we heartily subscribe to all its holy
   teachings, and especially emphasize the following, for which we earnestly
        contend, for the faith which was once delivered to the saints.

                                 Titus 2:11-14

    For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
    Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live
            soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and
                           our Saviour Jesus Christ;
Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify
            unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
