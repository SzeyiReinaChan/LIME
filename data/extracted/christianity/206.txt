Kairos of Alabama operates as a State Chapter and serves in prisons and jails
through a contractual agreement with the Warden and Chaplain of each
correctional facility. At present, we are in 13 facilities across the State of
Alabama. The Kairos Torch program is the way Kairos reaches out to juvenile
offenders, saying “There’s a better way.”  Also, there is a group of women who
minister to female family members of incarcerated men through the Kairos
Outside Ministry. 

We are part of an interdenominational Christian ministry reaching out to
incarcerated individuals, their families and those who work with them; to bring
sustainable meaning and hope in the place of loneliness, isolation and
despair.  It is our privilege to have the opportunity to introduce them to
Jesus and then show them the love he has shown us. With "God's Special Time" 
they have the opportunity to know the Kingdom of God.

There is nothing half hearted about God once you accept Him.
I'm proof of that.
