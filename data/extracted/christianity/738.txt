Reverend Dennis Weiss and "The Three Wives' Men"

Join us next week as Reverend Dennis Weiss and "The Three Wives' Men" lead us
in worship. 

"Their down-home, country, bluegrass style of music allows "Three Wives' Men"
to share the gospel of Jesus Christ and introduce others to the love of the
Lord, in a fun and uplifting and hope-filled way that touches the hearts of
people of all ages"
