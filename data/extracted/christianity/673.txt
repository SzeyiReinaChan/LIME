Thank You Lord

[sing-for-joy_1]

Lord God Almighty, I thank you for all the blessings you have given me. Thank
you for the life full of happiness and love. You have provided me with
everything I need. You gave me my family and friends who inspire, encourage and
bless me with love and kind words. They are always there to lift me up when I
feel down and in sorrow. If not because of you, I won’t be loved this much.
Thank you, oh lord, for your glorious and unwavering love and kindness. Even
with my sins and misgivings that made you suffer in the Cavalry, you still give
me the people who you knew can love and protect me the way you want to love and
protect me as my Father.

Lord God, I also thank you for granting all my prayers. Even with the wrong
doings I have done, you always find in your heart to listen and answer my
prayers. I have never imagined that you will bless me this much my Almighty
Father. You keep me safe by providing me home. You make me and my family secure
because of the work you have given me. Thank you Lord for providing me
everything according to your riches and glory, oh God.

Thank you Jesus Christ for your grace and mercy even with the disbelief and
weakness my flesh has shown over you. Thank you for the everyday life you have
given me. Thank you for allowing to me to see the beauty of sunrise and the
mystery of sunset again. But above all, thank you Father God for giving me
another chance to spend more time with my family and friends.  That alone oh
Lord is enough for me to thank you and be grateful for what you have done for
me, now and for always.

I know my Almighty Father that I am not worthy of your love and glory, of your
forgiving heart. But still Father God, accept my sincerest apologies and my
deepest thanks to you who gave me life, who gave me my happiness and who made
my life entirely complete. If not for you Jesus Christ, I wouldn’t be who I am
now. Thank you my Father and my Savior. In this I pray, in your name Lord Jesus
Christ, Amen.

Prayer of Hope and Redemption

[praying-th]

Heavenly Father, you are a merciful God! You know what is in my heart and I
call for you for help. Have mercy on your servant and help me gain redemption
from this wretchedness. Yours is an UNFAILING LOVE.

My hope and strength leaves me as men continue to criticize and degrade my
character. They have defiled my name and I have become an object of their
contempt. Many have hurt me and misunderstood my words and actions but you O
Lord, can comprehend the truest and deepest desires of my heart. I was
disgraced and my shame has dampened my spirits. I have walked with too much
burden and kept my eyes on the ground and have tried to avoid others. It has
become difficult to trust anyone. I was afraid to be treated the same way again
and again that I have withdrawn from others who offer of sympathy and
friendship and turned to you to be safe.

Come to my rescue O Father so that I may not give up and be inspired to
continue to do your will in my life. Dearest God and Father, I am truly
confused and downhearted. Have I sinned so great that they have done this to
me? Purify my heart and make me understand why these things are happening. Take
away my pride and humble me so that I will be able to see other people’s
perspective. Teach me your ways O Lord and correct me with your loving
kindness. Open my heart to opportunities to be changed and to be an instrument
for the change you want to happen. Use me mightily and let your hope burn
inside my heart so that I will be able to carry on and be more sensitive to
other people’s needs more than my own. For my hope is in you O Lord and I will
praise your name forever. You are my God and your faithfulness is forever
before me. I know that despite all these, you will continue to keep me safe and
protect me from the plans of my enemies. You have kept me in the past and you
are still doing so now. Thank you for reminding me that Your faithfulness is
great! In Jesus’ mighty name.

Amen.

Inspiring Prayer on New-Year's Day

[Happy-New-Year-2013]

O triune God, Thus have we again by Thy grace brought a year of our
wretched life and weary pilgrimage upon earth to a close, and to-day in
Thy name begin another. Lord! how unspeakably great is Thy goodness, how
innumerable are Thy benefits which Thou hast shown unto me and mine in
the past, though on account of our sins we have deserved nothing at Thy
hands but wrath and punishment! Thou hast graciously preserved Thy
precious Word and holy sacraments in Thy holy congregation, peace and
unity in the government, prosperity and blessing in material comforts,
and didst richly bestow for our enjoyment all manner of blessings for
body and soul. Thou with paternal care didst protect Thy church from
false doctrine and persecution on account of the true faith, our land
from hostile invasion and evil contagion, our houses and property from
fire and water, and didst by Thy care faithfully avert from us all dire
calamities. How shall I find words to express the inestimable value of
these blessings? How can I according to my obligations be sufficiently
thankful? Behold, Lord, I offer to Thee, at the close of the old year,
the fruits of my lips, and glorify Thy grace and mercy with all my
strength and powers. My soul must honor Thee, my spirit must praise Thee,
my mouth shall thank Thee, and all that is within me must proclaim Thy
glory. I prostrate myself in heartfelt sorrow before Thy feet and confess
unto Thee with a penitent heart all my sins in which I was conceived and
born, and with which I have offended Thee during the past year, as well
as during the whole of my past life.

Most beloved Father! do not now reckon such past sins to my condemnation,
and do not remember in Thy wrath my past transgressions, but graciously
forgive and forget the same for the sake of the sufferings of Thy dearly
beloved Son. Jesus, my beloved Saviour, be merciful to me, a poor sinner,
blot out like a cloud and mist all my transgressions by Thy merit, cast
them into the sea of Thy innocent blood, that they may never more come to
light or before the judgment of God. O God, Holy Spirit! create within me
the new man, that I may not bring into the new year old sins and
impurities, but to-day begin a new life and partake anew of Thy grace.
Withhold from me, O Triune God! all long and well deserved punishment,
and continue to bless me and mine with all manner of bodily and
spiritual, temporal and eternal gifts. Let Thy grace rest upon us anew
every morning, and renew Thy good will to all who in this new year seek
their refuge with Thee and wait upon Thy goodness. Grant unto us still
further Thy precious Word, which is a joy and comfort to our hearts.
Enlighten our teachers and preachers, and grant unto their holy work the
blessing of heaven; strengthen our faithful rulers and prosper all their
good undertakings, which are pleasing to Thee. Bless our parents, and
prosper Thou the work of their hands. Fill our souls with true fear of
God, and our hearts with joy in the Holy Ghost. Bestow unto our bodies
health, and grant peace within our borders. Crown this year with Thy
goodness and grant unto us that which is necessary to the support of
life. Protect Thy church from error in the faith and from scandalous
living, our land from war, famine and pestilence, our homes from
consuming flames and all damage and danger, the products of the field
from hail and tempest. Curb the wrath and fury of satan, and send Thy
heavenly hosts that they may guard and protect us in all our ways.
Convert our enemies and check all our persecutors, help the oppressed,
provide for the poor, feed the hungry, give drink unto the thirsty,
clothe the naked, free the innocent captives, comfort the distressed,
gladden the sorrowing, strengthen the weak, care for the sick, be
merciful to the widows and orphans, deliver the oppressed, guide the
traveler and accompany the dying through death unto life.

Lord! teach us to act according to Thy good pleasure, and Thy good Spirit
direct our footsteps, that we may walk before Thee in faith, patience and
hope, in godliness and honesty, in meekness, humility and chastity, and
all Christian virtues. But when we sin, then chastise us gently; when our
sins trouble us, comfort us with Thy grace, and Thy joyful Spirit uphold
us. When satan assails us, do Thou support us, when the world persecutes
us, then protect us; when our flesh and blood would overpower us, then
strengthen our spirit; when we err, set us aright again. When we fall,
lift us up by Thy hand. When we become weak and weary in our calling,
refresh us. When we are in necessity and danger, relieve us. When we are
sick and weak, then be our physician. Should we according to Thy will
during this year depart from hence, grant that our spirits be commended
into Thy hands. O Lord! hear; Lord! be merciful; Lord! take heed and
grant it for Jesus' sake. Amen.
