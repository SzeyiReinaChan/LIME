Million Pound Challenge 2016 Love Over Fear Committed Generosity 2015/16

First United Methodist Church in downtown Madison, Wisconsin is an active
ministry. From our  food ministries, homeless ministries and housing outreach
to our music ministries and youth programs, we are working to become the hands
and feet of God in the world. If you are looking for a way to serve others, to
nurture your spirit, or to feel part of a community - we invite you to join us.

Unless we are able to experience the wonder of the Resurrection in our own
lives, we risk missing the joy, the promise and indeed, the entire meaning of
Jesus' ministry. The transformative, life-giving power of the Christ is made
manifest every day. Experience it with us through service opportunities,
worship experiences and connections with others along this journey.

Worship - Watch & Listen
Whether you’re just in town for a visit and looking for a Sunday worship
service, or looking for a church home, we invite you to experience Christ with
us at First Church. Learn more about our worship services and education
programs, or listen to a recent sermon . Details on downtown parking are
available here.

We are a Reconciling Congregation , open to full participation of all persons
regardless of race, gender, economic status, national origin, religious
background, or sexual orientation.

We seek to embody grace and hospitality in the manner of Jesus, nurturing our
diverse spiritual journeys and joining together as a servant community to help
realize a more loving and just world.
