Being a Golden Hawk means more than just cheering on our (really good) varsity
teams – it means being a student who cares about your community, who works hard

    A Vibrant and Multifaith Community

    At Waterloo Lutheran Seminary, our students discover the best of all worlds
    – the close-knit social community of a small college, the rich diversity of
    a dynamic city, and all the amenities of a world-class university.

At Waterloo Lutheran Seminary (WLS), the founding institution of Wilfrid
Laurier University, our ecumenical, multifaith and inclusive contact creates a
diverse and vibrant community committed to faith in service of the common good.
At WLS, you will experience a place where spirituality accompanies academic
curiosity to inspire global citizenship.

For more than 100 years, we have educated leaders for church and the world.
Through our programs, you’ll learn the art of engaging the resources of a
public faith in response to the demands of a changing world. Our association
with Laurier provides resources for you to pursue research and scholarly
interests in an environment that fosters a high standard of academic
excellence.

Our graduates find rewarding careers where they serve, with heart, in various
roles such as counsellors, pastors, ministers, chaplains and social workers.
