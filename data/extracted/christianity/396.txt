Welcome to Our Church

Under the protective mantle of our Holy Mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, the
Parishioners of St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church strive to follow the
examples and teaching of her son Jesus Christ by engaging in the Holy Eucharist
and actively living our Catholic faith through prayer, education, fellowship
and works.
