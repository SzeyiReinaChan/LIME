Local and Global Mission

image1We join in several different shared ministries in our community and
around the world. We are one of the original Egan Warming Center sites. We have
hosted a week of Family Shelter for 25 years now. We are a Love INC partner
church. And we support the ministry of the Eugene City Mission.

We join with other Covenant churches to send and support missionaries around
the world as well as supporting a missionary from Valley Covenant. Our missions
interest group meets monthly to pray for missionaries and to help keep our
congregation informed about the work of the Lord in places like China and
India.
