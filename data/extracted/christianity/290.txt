Updated April 30, 2015.

"Doctor of the Church" is a title given to those whose writings are deemed to
be in accord with the doctrine of the church and which the church believes can
be used as teachings. "Doctor" in this sense is related etymologically to the
word "doctrine."

There's some irony in this title for these women, as the church has used words
of Paul as an argument against ordination of women: Paul's words are usually
interpreted to forbid women from teaching in the church.

Learn more about these women in the following pages.
