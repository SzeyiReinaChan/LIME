Are you interested in joining the Catholic faith?

The process by which those who are not Roman Catholic can inquire into becoming
members of the faith community called the Rite of Christian Initiation of
Adults (RCIA.) This is a process whereby adults who are not baptized or who
have been baptized into another Christina faith tradition are initiated into
the Roman Catholic Church. This initiation is a spiritual journey: varied,
individual and free.
