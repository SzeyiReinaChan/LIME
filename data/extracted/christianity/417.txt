Belief with  Integrity

At St. Andrew’s we believe that God delights in the diversity of all creation. 
We are a reconciling, affirming and inclusive Christian community striving
through worship, love and service to welcome all people.  No matter where you
are in your journey of faith; whether you are single, married, divorced,
separated, or partnered, our welcome knows no boundaries of age, race,
ethnicity, culture, gender, sexual orientation, economic condition, physical or
mental ability.

About Us

'We are a warm, welcoming, accepting, and nurturing collection of folks brought
together for a myriad of reasons and circumstances, but committed to listening
to the Holy Spirit and following the example of Jesus Christ. Since our
establishment more than 155 years ago, we have responded to God’s call to reach
beyond our walls and become instruments of God’s healing and peace.

Join Us

We would love for you to join us Sunday morning or Wednesday evening as we
break bread, celebrate God's goodness, and go forth to share the light with the
world. We delight in incorporating our ancient liturgy and rich musical
tradition with energy and relevance for today's people. We wish you God speed
on your spiritual journey and know our community would be blessed by your
presence.
