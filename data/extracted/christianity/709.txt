The Live Nativity was a huge success again for Christmas 2015.  Over 300
gathered to enjoy the beautiful story of Jesus’ birth. To those attending: 
Thank You! Please know you are a blessing to this community. To the cast and
crew: What awesome pageantry and a wonderful performance! Thank You!  To
everyone who brought delicious soups, sandwiches and sweets:  We are so
grateful. You warmed our chilled bodies and nourished our hearts, so that we
would know the Spirit of the Season and could share the Good News of Jesus
Christ!
