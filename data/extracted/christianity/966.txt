Real...Relevant...Relentless

Durand United Methodist Church takes going to church to a whole new level. We
emphasize building relationships that are real, teaching that is relevant and
worship that is relentless. Our friendly, casual environment creates a place
for everyone, regardless of the past or present situation, to experience the
love and acceptance of Jesus Christ.
