                             Reflections of the Day

"Baptized with the Holy Spirit and fire"
Do you want to be on fire for God? John the Baptist said that the Messiah would
"baptize with
the Holy Spirit and with fire." Fire in biblical times was associated with God
and with his
action in the world and in the lives of his people. God sometimes manifested
his presence by
use of fire, such as the burning bush which was not consumed when God spoke to
Moses
(Exodus 3:2). The image of fire was also used to symbolize God's glory (Ezekiel
1:4, 13), his
protective presence (2 Kings 6:17), his holiness (Deuteronomy 4:24), righteous
judgment
(Zechariah 13:9), and his wrath against sin (Isaiah 66:15-16). It is also used
of the Holy Spirit
(Matthew 3:11 and Acts 2:3). God's fire both purifies and cleanses, and it
inspires a reverent
fear of God and of his word in us.
Jesus will baptize with the Holy Spirit and fire
Jesus came to give us the fire of his Spirit that we may radiate the joy and
truth of the Gospel to
a world in desperate need of God's light and truth. His word has power to
change and transform
our lives that we may be lights pointing others to Christ. Like John the
Baptist, we too are
called to give testimony to the light and truth of Jesus Christ. Do you want
the Lord's power,
grace, and love to burn brightly in your life? Ask him to fill you with his
Holy Spirit.
John preached a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins (Luke 3:3).
Why did Jesus,
the Sinless One, submit himself to John's baptism? In this humble submission we
see a
foreshadowing of the "baptism" of his bloody death upon the cross. Jesus'
baptism is the
acceptance and the beginning of his mission as God? suffering Servant. He
allowed himself to
be numbered among sinners. Jesus submitted himself entirely to his Father's
will. Out of love
he consented to this baptism of death for the remission of our sins. Do you
know the joy of trust
and submission to God?
Jesus' baptism - beginning of a new creation
The Father proclaimed his entire delight in his Son and spoke audibly for all
to hear. The Holy
Spirit, too, was present as he anointed Jesus for his ministry which began that
day as he rose
from the waters of the Jordan river. Jesus will be the source of the Spirit for
all who come to
believe in him. At his baptism the heavens were opened and the waters were
sanctified by the
descent of Jesus and the Holy Spirit, signifying the beginning of a new
creation.
Heaven will open for those who bow before the Lord
How can we enter into the mystery of Jesus' humble self-abasement and baptism?
Gregory of
Nazianzus (329-389 AD), an early church father tells us: "Let us be buried with
Christ by
Baptism to rise with him; let us go down with him to be raised with him; and
let us rise with
him to be glorified with him." Do you want to see your life transformed? And do
you want to
become a more effective instrument of the Gospel? Examine Jesus' humility and
ask the Holy
Spirit to forge this same attitude in your heart. As you do, heaven will open
for you as well.
The Lord Jesus is ever ready to renew and refashion us through his Spirit and
to anoint us for
mission as his ambassadors. We are called to be "light" and |salt" to those
around us. The Lord
wants his love and truth to shine through us that others may see the goodness
and truth of God's
message of salvation. Ask the Lord Jesus to fill you with his Holy Spirit that
you may radiate
the joy of the Gospel to those around you.

We Pray:
"Lord Jesus, fill me with your Holy Spirit and inflame my heart with the joy of
the Gospel. May I find joy in seeking to please you just as you found joy in
seeking to please your Father."
