Welcome to the Parish Portal for St. Paul Catholic Church in Elton, Louisiana.

MOTHER TERESA’S PRAYER

 People are often unreasonable, irrational, and self-centered. Forgive them
anyway.

  If you are kind, people may accuse you of selfish, ulterior motives. Be kind
anyway.

   If you are successful, you will win some unfaithful friends and some genuine
enemies. Succeed anyway.

  If you are honest and sincere people may deceive you. Be honest and sincere
anyway.

 What you spend years creating, others could destroy overnight. Create anyway.

  If you find serenity and happiness, some may be jealous. Be happy anyway.

  The good you do today, will often be forgotten. Do good anyway.

  Give the best you have, and it will never be enough. Give your best anyway.

  In the final analysis, it is between you and God. It was never between you
and them anyway.

                                                                                                                                                                                              
……………………Mother Teresa
