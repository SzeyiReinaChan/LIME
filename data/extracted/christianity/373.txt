The Mission Next Door: Camp Polaris

We all know that mission fields exist around the world, but did you know there
is a mission in our own backyard? A portion of this month's Sabbath School
mission offering will be going to Camp Polaris, a summer camp operated by the
Alaska Conference on the remote Lake Aleknagik outside of Dillingham. The camp,
which operates for one week each summer, is in desperate need of some upgrades.

Spotlight on Mission

The mission of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the North Pacific Union
Conference is to prepare people for the imminent return of Jesus Christ by
nurturing, educating and motivating its membership. We will empower our
conferences to help each member demonstrate God's character of love through the
power of the Holy Spirit and share the gospel message with other people through
the development of individual spiritual gifts.
