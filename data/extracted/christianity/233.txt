                    The monastery was founded in 1897 from Downside
                    as a parish, at the invitation of Cardinal
                    Vaughan, then Archbishop of Westminster. It was
                    canonically erected as a dependent Priory in
                    1916, with Dom Wulstan Pearson as its first
                    Prior; he became the first Bishop of Lancaster
                    in 1925. In 1947 it became an independent
                    Conventual Priory, and in 1955 it was raised to
                    the status of an Abbey by Pope Pius XII with
                    Dom Charles Pontifex as its first Abbot. A
                    School was started by Dom Sebastian Cave in
                    1902. It is now fully co-educational.and there
                    are now about 770 pupils in the Senior School
                    and 300 pupils in the Junior School.

                    The Parish, served from the monastery, is one
                    of the largest in the country. There is guest
                    accommodation for individuals who wish to spend
                    some time apart or share our life, and there is
                    a flourishing group of Oblates.
