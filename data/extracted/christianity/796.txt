cuadro2 cuadro3    St. Philip’s UMC serves Round Rock and the
cuadro4 cuadro5    central Texas region as a community of
                   Christ-followers who seek to follow God’s call
                   to a ministry of reconciliation- God to
                   humanity, and people to one another.
                   
                   We enjoy each other’s company and we enjoy
                   sharing the love of Jesus.  We have felt his
                   love warm our hearts, and we’ve seen Him change
                   our lives.  We invite anyone to join us in
                   following God, and discovering the awesome power
                   of God’s grace and love in their own lives.
