Saint Benedict's Abbey is a community of Benedictine monks located on the state
boarders of Wisconsin and Illinois. Our Abbey is located in the Archdiocese of
Milwaukee but we serve both the Archdiocese of Milwaukee and Chicago. Founded
in 1945 by Richard Felix, O.S.B., a monk of Conception, Missouri.

Our focus is our ministry of prayer, with the celebration of the Liturgy of the
Hours and daily Mass. We gather six times a day to sing and offer praise to
God. Another important and major focus of our life is the ministry of our
retreat house. Our abbey has been the site for many individuals and groups to
find a path closer to God.

Before you leave our web pages please take a few minutes to view our retreat
house section. We belong to the Swiss-American Congregation, www.osb.org/
swissam and the worldwide Benedictine Confederation, http://
atlas.osb-international.info/index/en.html
Please take a few moments to read my welcome message and explore some of the
other areas of our website. WELCOME!
Father Prior Donald, O.S.B.

Monastic Hospitality

In Chapter 53 of the Rule about "The Reception of Guests," Saint Benedict,
reminds Christians to receive all guests as they would welcome Him, for Christ
Himself will say, as the Bible tells us: "I was a stranger and you welcomed me"
(Matt 25:35).
