Our Mission


We are the temple of the living God, transformed by the Spirit into sacred
vessels for the treasure of Christ. Like the monstrance, we present the love
and light of Christ for all to see. Together, we become the dwelling place of
God.
We are proud of the relics we host for the Catholic community.Learn about St.
