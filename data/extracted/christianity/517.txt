Hold On!

I am coming soon. Hold on to what you have.
 

Revelation 3:11

A cowboy friend of mine who grew up on a ranch in Texas has a number of
colorful sayings. One of my favorites is “It don’t take much water to make good
coffee.” And when someone ropes a steer too big to handle or is in some kind of
trouble, my friend will shout, “Hold everything you’ve got!” meaning “Help is
on the way! Don’t let go!”

In the book of Revelation we find letters to “the seven churches in the
province of Asia” (chs. 2–3). These messages from God are filled with
encouragement, rebuke, and challenge, and they speak to us today just as they
did to the first-century recipients.
Holding on to God's promises in hard times strengthens our faith.

Twice in these letters we find the phrase, “Hold on to what you have.” The Lord
told the church at Thyatira, “Hold on to what you have until I come” (2:25).
And to the church in Philadelphia He said, “I am coming soon. Hold on to what
you have, so that no one will take your crown” (3:11). In the midst of great
trials and opposition, these believers clung to God’s promises and persevered
in faith.

When our circumstances are harsh and sorrows outnumber joys, Jesus shouts to
us, “Hold everything you’ve got! Help is on the way!” And with that promise, we
can hold on in faith and rejoice.

Lord, we cling to Your promise, expect Your return, and hold on with confidence
as we say, “Even so, come, Lord Jesus!”

The promise of Christ’s return calls us to persevere in faith.

Insight:

The detailed description of Jesus in Revelation 1 underscores the authority by
which the letters to the seven churches in chapters 2–3 were written and the
certainty of their contents. They contain evaluations, warnings, and
promises—alternately praising or condemning the churches for their faith or
lack of it.

    HOLD TO GOD’S UNCHANGING HAND:

    Time is filled with swift transition,
    Naught of earth unmoved can stand,
    Build your hopes on things eternal,
    Hold to God’s unchanging hand.
    Refrain:
    Hold to God’s unchanging hand,
    Hold to God’s unchanging hand;
    Build your hopes on things eternal,
    Hold to God’s unchanging hand.

    Trust in Him who will not leave you,
    Whatsoever years may bring,
    If by earthly friends forsaken
    Still more closely to Him cling.
    Covet not this world’s vain riches
    That so rapidly decay,
    Seek to gain the heav’nly treasures,
    They will never pass away.

    When your journey is completed,
    If to God you have been true,
    Fair and bright the home in glory
    Your enraptured soul will view.

    I too am encouraged to to hold on to Christ in times of great joy and
    sorrow, I need prayer as I face the challenges of everyday life and
    ministry as I carry the Cross to new places. God has called me to take His
    Cross to all people. Thanks for your prayers
    James

        I will pray for you for sure. Just know that in Scripture, our Father
        tells us that He will never leave us or forsake us. As you carry the
        Cross to new places, He will uphold you…..and carry you when you feel
        the weakest. If God brings you to it, He will guide you through it.
        Thanks be to our Father.

    ♫And it holds, my anchor holds:
    Blow your wildest, then, O gale,
    On my bark so small and frail;
    By His grace I shall not fail,
    For my anchor holds, my anchor holds.♫

        Oops-did not mean to send it twice, but I guess that just reinforces
        that no matter what happens=”My Anchor Must Hold!”
