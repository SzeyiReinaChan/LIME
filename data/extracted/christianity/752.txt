Serving the Developmentally Disabled

Serving the Developmentally Disabled

Our service includes: donations to private schools educating developmentally
disabled children and providing them with vocational skills; participating in
Special Olympics; conducting recreation, field day programs and summer camps;
providing field trips, boat rides, zoo trips, circus trips, picnics, Christmas
parties, dinner dances, etc.

Memorializing Catholic History

A major purpose of the Order of Alhambra is to identify, mark, preserve, and
commemorate Catholic historical places, events and persons of international or
regional importance. Over 160 such memorials have been established in Canada
and the United States.

Sociability

Sociability is a dominant characteristic of the Order. It flows from another
stated purpose of the Order, namely, “To promote social, fraternal and
intellectual associations and through its Caravans provide a practical means to
form enduring fellowship and friendship among its members.” The Order is a
“fun” organization dedicated to doing worthwhile charitable work.
