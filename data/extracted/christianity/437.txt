Dear Friends,Installation Picture

 

When I was a young boy, the beginning of the Little League baseball season
filled me with an enormous sense of happy expectation: imagine all the coming
doubles, and triples..and maybe even home runs! The diving catches! The
last-out heroics! The grape snow cones after the games! And above all, the
endless hours of batting practice with my Dad, which was my favorite part of
baseball. I couldn’t wait to get started with the baseball season.

 

That’s something like how I feel now as we begin the JUBILEE YEAR OF MERCY.
With the other priests here, there’s an almost tangible expectation of amazing
the things to come for us and for the whole parish family.  Imagine all the
amazing ways hearts will be touched by the works of mercy at our parish! Hearts
touched by the Sacrament of Mercy in the Confessional! Hearts strengthened by
the Jubilee indulgence! Hearts discovering the abiding Presence of Christ in
the Eucharist! Families healing from divisions! We can’t wait to get started.

 

Though there is much more to come, take a look at the basic backbone of our
parish plan for the Year of Mercy. We will begin this plan Jan 3, 2016 and end
November 13, 2016:

  • Expanded opportunities for the Sacrament of Reconciliation: AFTER EVERY
    SUNDAY MASS. In addition we will have the Sacrament of Reconciliation
    available 3:30-4:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday!
  • Wednesday Night “Mercy Night”, 7 pm- 9 pm: a candlelit contemplative time
    of informal, flexible prayer in the presence of exposed Blessed Sacrament;
    priests available for Confession and/or spiritual direction. Come alone or
    with others; come for 5 minutes or 2 hours and catch your spiritual breath
    for the week.
  • Two special Year of Mercy Masses on Monday and Saturday at 6:15 am,
    preceded by Adoration and available Confessions at 5:45 am. Get your week
    started and ended with Mercy! Great for people who work or with busy family
    schedules.

 

cq5dam.web.1280.1280Much more to come, but this is the backbone of our parish
plan for the Year of Mercy. I can’t wait to dive in. Jubilee Years are always
game-changers because God is so ridiculously good to us, especially in these
special grace-filled years. So grab your spiritual cleats, bats, and gloves,
and play ball. The year is just beginning. Imagine the amazing things that will
happen to us once we step onto the field.

 

In Joyful Expectation of Christ’s Victory,

Fr Muir

It’s a joy to do a “preaching series” from time to time—a focused exploration
of a particular timely theme of our Catholic faith for our spiritual benefit.
This is one of those times! We are doing a three-Sunday homily series on
masculinity.   Fr. John Muir Part 1-https://soundcloud.com/stthomasaquinas/

Dear Friends in Christ, It probably wasn’t the most prudent decision, but I did
it anyway.          I was 18 years old. On the desktop was a piece of paper
that read, “Caption for Senior Yearbook Picture”. Instead of a pithy saying, an
inside joke, or a shout-out to friends, I wanted something that really […]

Dear Friends in Christ, One month has come and gone since I arrived here at St.
Thomas Aquinas. What a month it’s been. I spent the first two weeks getting to
know the deacons and priests, as well as the parish staff, and the general
inner workings of our parish’s administration. The next two weeks […]
