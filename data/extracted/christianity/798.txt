Come and See Go and Tell

“. . . But grace was given to each of us
according to the measure of Christ’s gift.
And His gifts were that some should be apostles,
some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers,
to equip the saints for the work of ministry,
for building up the body of Christ . . .”
Ephesians 4:7, 11-12

Cursillo 2.0 is patterned on Jesus’ own example. He searched out and called a
small group of potential leaders; He trained them by word and example and
inspired them with a vision; He linked them together and sent them out into the
world to bring the world to Him.

The Secretariat has discerned the following mission and vision to focus the
Come and See – Cursillo 2.0 ministry in the Diocese of Olympia:

Our Vision: Cursillo 2.0 is a ministry of the church providing opportunities
to develop a deeper knowledge and understanding of the Risen Christ.

Our Mission: We accomplish our vision by:

  • Inviting God’s presence in our everyday life;
  • Embracing our various gifts and talents as sacred, and
  • Transforming our world by proclaiming the extraordinary in the ordinary.
