Becoming a member of ECO: A Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians

On June 16, 2012, our congregation joined a very young denomination, ECO: A
Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians. How we got to that place is a
journey of faith and discernment.

The beginning of our story really begins with our pastor going to a gathering
of Presbyterians in Minneapolis in August 2011. At this gathering the
Fellowship of Presbyterians, now the Fellowship Community, was formed with the
idea of like-minded individuals coming together to correct what was happening
in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.).

Out of that initial gathering it seemed that there were three groups of
thought. First, there were those who were unsure about what to do. Second,
there were those who liked the idea of staying in the PC(USA) and working to
change the denomination. They remained the Fellowship Community. Third, there
were those who thought the PC(USA) was beyond change and wanted to become apart
of something else. As a way of moving towards that end, a Theology Task Force
and a Polity Committee were created. Our pastor became a member of that
committee and set out to create the polity of what was being called a New
Reformed Body.

In January 2012, the Covenanting Conference was held in Orlando, Fla. to
officially announce the formation of ECO: Evangelical Covenant Order of
Presbyterians. At the conference John Ortberg gave a impassioned presentation,
A Vision for Ministry and Introduction of ECO.

Shortly after the formation of ECO, the named was changed at the request of the
Evangelical Covenant Church. The process of recognition as a denomination began
with an application and eventual acceptance to the World Communion of Reformed
Churches. By June 2012, we had joined with five other churches who wished to be
dismissed from the PC(USA) to ECO. Our request was granted.
