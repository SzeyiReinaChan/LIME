                                  WHO WE ARE
The only way to know someone is to know their story. At Northwest, our story is
simple. It is a story about acceptance, forgiveness, and salvation through
Jesus Christ. It is also a story about a group of people. Our congregation is
composed of hundreds of people from all walks and categories of life. At
Northwest, you will not find perfect people, but you will find men and women of
all ages who are learning to live as Christians in this journey we call life.
We invite you to join with us in your journey, and become a part of our story.
