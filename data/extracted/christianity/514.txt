                       FREE Help for those who struggle with Homosexuality.

                       _
                       Greetings,

                       If you are struggling with homosexuality or sexual
                       compulsion, you are not alone. God loves you.

                       You have probably struggled with this issue for some
                       time and have felt shame because you could not
                       overcome it. We want to help you.

                       Here are some myths about Christians and
                       Homosexuality.



                       MYTH #1 REAL CHRISTIANS DONT LUST AFTER WHAT I DO.

                       Nothing could be further from the truth. In every
                       church in America there are those who are suffering
                       the same things you are dealing with. But we dont
                       know it because these people are called "Silent
                       Sufferers". They have learned to smile wide and keep
                       the truth hidden because they fear people will not
                       accept them if they admit their struggles.



                       MYTH #2 READ THE BIBLE AND IT WILL GO AWAY

                       This generalization is hurting countless souls who
                       desperately want to be free. Both you and I know
                       that if reading the Bible could make it just "go
                       away" we would have been free years ago.


                       MYTH #3 PRAY HARD ENOUGH AND YOU'LL BE CURED.

                       See answer for Number 2.




                       NOW FOR THE TRUTH!

                       TRUTH #1

                       There are many God loving believers who are secretly
                       suffering with homosexual urges and addiction to
                       lust. These people LOVE God and they want to be
                       free. Are you one of them?

                       TRUTH #2

                       There are a variety of reasons that Homosexuality
                       can occur in a person.

                       Child Abuse
                       Child Neglect
                       Child Abandonment
                       A head injury during infancy/childhood
                       Physical abuse
                       Fear of Parental Rage
                       Chronic Low Self Esteem
                       Self Loathing
                       Other issues including Brain Chemistry

                   _ _ TRUTH #3                                             _

                       There is healing!

                       TRUTH #4

                       Healing will take time.

                       Expect it and accept it.

                       This is a pattern of thinking your mind has
                       "learned" and it will take time to "unlearn and
                       renew" your mind.

                       Dont listen to ANYONE who says that simply praying
                       hard will make it go away. If it did, you wouldn't
                       be suffering!


                       THERE IS HOPE!
