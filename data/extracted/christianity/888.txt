      [navi_dazwischen]           [c50df40b480ea146ffff85f5ffffe41e]We exist to promote and defend the historic
      Archives                    liturgy of the Church, as it has come to us from Western Christendom. This
      [navi_dazwischen]           work, because of its very nature, is also deeply rooted in the Gospel itself,
      Sabre of Boldness           which is why we feel justified in commenting on doctrinal and exegetical
      [navi_dazwischen]           matters too, to an extent. The liturgy and the Gospel it encases are integrally
      Contact us                  related. This is unquestionable when it comes to the sermon, so we have always
      [navi_dazwischen]           dedicated a substantial amount of space to sermons and to writings about
                                  sermons. Sermons are part of the liturgy: the preaching of the Gospel is a
                                  liturgical activity. We believe that when preaching is weak, liturgical follies
                                  will likely be nearby, whether either forerunning or coming soon afterwards.
                                  Where the Gospel is not clearly understood, with all its sacramental
                                  implications, it is not surprising to see churches being stripped of the
                                  decorum that has historically accompanied it.

                                  Put another way, when Christ is not proclaimed as the One who sits on the
                                  altar—whose true body and blood that were offered to God for the sin of the
                                  world are given to the Church for the remission of sins—when this reality is
                                  not understood or clearly confessed, then there is nothing left but window
                                  dressing and show. Why concern yourself with paraments and vestments, or with
                                  liturgical propriety and rubrics, if the reason for all this is missing?
                                  Gottesdienst aims to provide a defense for the liturgy by confessing in no
                                  uncertain terms what the liturgy is for. We don’t genuflect, or make the sign
                                  of the cross, or bow, just because it’s the faddish thing to do, or because we
                                  happen to think it would be stylish to look Catholic. We do happen to do those
                                  things for pretty much the same reason they do them, though in their case it
                                  might be more of a matter of obligation than of confession, considering the
                                  fact that they have for centuries had a penchant for speaking of matters of the
                                  Gospel in terms of “holy obligations.” We are, however, quite willing to agree
                                  that where Christ is present, there solemnity is appropriate, and any lack of
                                  solemnity is inappropriate.

                                  In our own Lutheran settings, we’ve been dealing more urgently with this
                                  greater problem, this lack of solemnity. We take that liturgical observation as
                                  symptomatic of a greater infirmity. When people lack reverence and solemnity,
                                  what they lack is a sense of awe. When they lack that, it can only be because
                                  they are unaware of Who is present before them. They might deny this, but
                                  seriously: if you had opportunity to have a place in the upper room on Easter,
                                  would you act casually? Would you not be overcome? Thomas certainly was, on the
                                  Sunday after Easter. Though he was undoubtedly thrilled, we can surmise his
                                  (necessarily spontaneous) liturgical response to have been something like that
                                  of the Wise Men, or of the returning leper. Nor would it have been for him
                                  merely out of holy obligation that he replied, “My Lord and my God” (St. John
                                  20:28). It was because of what he knew, what he could not deny.

                                  .       Or if you want liturgical observations that are truthful, insightful,

                                  .       Or if you want encouragement to stand firm in the faith

                                  .       Or if you’re a pastor who hasn’t yet taken the step of ordering a bulk
                                  subscription for your congregation.  You know, if they read something you’re
                                  already trying to tell them, they might be easier to convince.

                                  [c50df40b480ea146ffff85f6ffffe41e]The German word Gottesdienst (literally,
                                  "God's service") may be defined as both "divine service" and "public worship."
                                  The first and fundamental definition has to do with God's sacramental service
                                  toward man in the preaching of the Word and the administration of the
                                  Sacraments. The subordinate definition portrays man's sacrificial service
                                  toward God in the offering of hymns, prayers, etc. We propose that the historic
                                  Divine Service of the Western Christian Church is more than the cobwebs
                                  of antiquity. It is a theological treasure, which is most needed in today's
                                  Christian Church. The slogan Leitourgia Divina adiaphora non est (lit., "The
                                  Divine Liturgy is not adiaphora [indifferent things]") reflects this
                                  conviction.
