The Methodist Church Chester & Stoke-on-Trent District covers much of Cheshire
and North Staffordshire. We are a very diverse district with towns packed with
history like Chester and Nantwich, with rural communities on the Cheshire
plains and the Shropshire moors, the pottery towns that now make up the City of
Stoke, market towns and many signs of past industries and new ones emerging.

Our churches too are diverse, yet each seeking to be authentic to its calling
to be a Christian presence characterised by worship, mission, service, care and
nurture. Across the district we seek to relate our Christian faith to the world
in which we live and the people in the communities in which we are set.

We hope this website gives you a feel for what we believe, what we do, and
encourages you to share in the journey of faith.
