Gregory the Great

Gregory the Great was pope from 590-604 and left behind a substantial literary
heritage. His most ambitious work and one of the most popular works of
scriptural exegesis in the middle ages was the Moralia in Iob, commenting the
book of Job in 35 books running to over half a million words. The flavor of the
work may be found from the highly "confessional" last page of the text,
available here in Latin and in English. See also my study, 'The Holiness of
Gregory'.

A draft translation, made in the early 1980s and never satisfactorily revised,
of the first five books is provided here:

  • Book One
  • Book Two
  • Book Three
  • Book Four
  • Book Five

As of 18 September 1994, only the first book is in HTML with footnotes to click
on; the others appear in a rougher, all-ASCII form, with the footnotes missing.
Better later, si deus nos adiuvet. Comments, corrections, suggestions,
improvements to jod@georgetown.edu.
