Welcome to Agapé!

We invite you to visit Agapé and learn more about a deeper relationship with
Jesus. The Bible encourages us in Hebrews "Let us not give up meeting
together...but let us encourage one another...". That is why we believe in the
importance of gathering each week as a community to worship, to learn from
teachings and to fellowship.

Sermon Podcasts
