  • Welcome

    Welcome!  We hope you enjoy browsing our web-site.  We are a community of
    10,000 Catholics in 3 parishes and 1 Catholic school in 3 towns.  Our
    parishes are St. Bartholomew in Cape Elizabeth, St. Maximilian Kolbe in
    Scarborough, St. John and Holy Cross in South Portland.  Our Catholic
    school is Holy Cross School in South Portland.  Even though our Catholic
    school bears the name of one of our churches, it is truly supported by all
    of our parishes.  Each of our parishes are active and vibrant communities
    with their own unique traditions and character.  We continue the mission of
    Christ through our various ministries, some of which are administered
    cluster-wide.  Please don't hesitate to call us with any questions.
