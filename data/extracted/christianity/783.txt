    Mission Statement:

    "We, the Sisters of the Third Order Regular of St. Francis, Oldenburg, are
    women of prayer, committed to the Gospel values as lived by St. Francis and
    Mother Theresa Hackelmeier. From our life in community we are sent to extend
    the mission of Jesus through our presence and service. Enlivened by a spirit of
    justice, reconciliation and peace, we collaborate with others in responding to
    the needs of the world."

    We fulfill these words by being women of prayer in the ministries we do and the
    places where we are present. Since Vatican II opened the doors to the many
    needs of the world, we minister in education, parish ministry, social service,
    healthcare and social justice.
