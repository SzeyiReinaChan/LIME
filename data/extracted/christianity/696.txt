    Welcome to First Baptist Church of Herndon

    I believe our church has been given a unique mission by God. God is calling
    us to do special ministry that no other church can do. Think about our
    church and the many things what make us unique. Even though Northern
    Virginia is growing in its racial diversity, few churches in this area are
    as diverse as we are. Read more... Pastor Sean Roberds

The weather in our area was really out of character for the month of December.
The temperatures were above normal, and the precipitation was in the form of
rain, never snow.
