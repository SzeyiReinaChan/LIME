We are a lively and welcoming church, made up of different ages, backgrounds,
experiences and temperaments.  We seek to live faithfully as followers of
Jesus, with all the joys and the challenges that brings. At the heart of this
is a strong commitment to sharing the love of God within our local community
and beyond. Whether you have been a Christian for a long time, or you are new
to the Christian Faith; whether you want a safe place to find out more about
Christianity, or you are looking for a place to pause, take stock of your life
and refresh your spirit, you will be very welcome here.

We are located here

St Helen's, Witton, often known as 'Northwich Parish Church', is situated close
to the centre of Northwich, Cheshire, England. Our neighbourhood is very
varied; the parish extends from the town centre to the edge of the urban area
and so includes the businesses of the town centre and also more residential
areas. This is a church where successive generations have gathered week by week
for worship and where the life events of  baptisms, weddings and funerals have
taken place over hundreds of years. As you look around our church, there are
many reminders of the history of the building and within that, the memory that
at each stage in that history, real people came into this house of God and left
their mark.
