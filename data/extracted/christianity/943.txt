    In those days and in that time, declares the Lord, the people of Israel and
    the people of Judah shall come together, weeping as they come, and they
    shall seek the Lord their God. They shall ask the way to Zion, with faces
    turned toward it, saying, ‘Come, let us join ourselves to the Lord in an
    everlasting covenant that will never be forgotten.’

    –JEREMIAH 50:4-5

Welcome

The members of Zion United Reformed Church are pleased to welcome you to our
website. A sincere invitation is extended to you to participate in our programs
and ministry. We are a Protestant Church, belonging to a fellowship of
congregations known as the United Reformed Churches in North America. We
believe in Jesus Christ as the Son of God and our only savior from sin. By the
name “Reformed” we say that we stand in the tradition of the historic
Protestant Reformation. We accept the Bible as the inspired, inerrant, and
unchanging Word of God, seeking to be Reformed by that Word and the power of
the Holy Spirit.
