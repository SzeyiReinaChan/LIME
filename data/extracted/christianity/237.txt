    WellsFest

Loving, caring, sharing. Those are the words listed on the sign in front of
Wells Church, but those words are more than a saying or a motto. They embody
the spirit and mission of this congregation, which worships and carries on the
work of Christ in the inner city of Jackson, Mississippi. All are truly welcome
in this place. We consider ourselves as fellow strugglers, a branch of the vine
of Christ, seeking to love the Lord, serve others and be faithful witnesses to
God through service and love in the name of Jesus Christ. We sincerely welcome
you and invite you to join in the loving, caring and sharing that is Wells
Church.

WellsFest 2015 -

Keith Writes about Families in Red Door, Green Door   

[2616]


    Keith Tonkel has long preached about family, but he has put some of his
family stories down in his new book, Red Door, Green Door.

    Amazon describes Keith's new book like this: "Red Door, Green Door
  explores families, adoption and being chosen in this delightful and
meaningful children's book."

   Keith writes in the prelude: "There are different kinds of doors: big ones,
little ones, red doors, green doors, and others. Doors are about coming in and
going out. This is about coming in doors..."

   Red Door, Green Door was illustrated by our own Kit Fields and truly is a
delightful book in message and illustration.

    Red Door, Green Door was published by The Hour Books with assistance by The
Hour's Anthony Thaxton.

   Red Door, Green Door is available at the church office for $12 and can be
ordered from Amazon.com. 

 

 

 

[2617]Welcome to Wells

We're glad you're looking at us!  We'd love to have you come into our life and
love, but that is your choice. We believe it is best to come and look and feel
and share. Perhaps then you'll want to take steps toward commitment toward
Christ and to us.

We need you and want you. And yet, we know that it is only when you are really
ready to come in that it will mean the most to you and then to others.

Please come again.  If we're a source of God's blessing, we're glad about that.
 If not, give us another chance...or come and help us do it better. 

We're here to offer God's love and blessing to those called to us, and to serve
God in this exciting and challenging time.

-Keith Tonkel
