[I-love-them-300x225]Dominican Republic

The beauty of the Dominican Republic stands in contrast with the physical and
spiritual poverty of many on the island. Many nominally claim Catholicism as
their religion but have no understanding of a personal relationship with God.
The evangelical church is growing, and many are coming to know Christ as their
personal Lord.

They are anxious to have mission groups come and encourage them. Medical and
sports teams, vacation Bible schools, sharing at our schools, construction
projects can all be part of the work God is doing in the Dominican Republic.
Outreach opportunities are endless! Come join us in this exciting, very
popular, mission field!

Florida

COI’s 16 years of hands-on experience pioneering Central Florida missions gives
us expertise at making your Florida outreach a success! In 1997, COI started
receiving teams in Indian River County. Because there was nothing like it in
the area,COI’s influence in Florida grew. Our faithfulness and experience has
created an impact affecting the entire region.

Over the years,hundreds of volunteers and mission teams have been blessed,
serving with COI in Florida. We have found that doing outreach and community
service here (domestic missions) is safe, warm, economical, fun, and a great
way to touch lives in our own country!

Today, COI is building and strengthening our legacy of outreach and service in
Florida. Our International HQ remains in Vero Beach. There are lots of good
ministry opportunities in Florida, so we have expanded to include Orlando, and
we are working on Tampa-St. Pete area for 2015.

COI #RethinkingTraffickinginAmerica Project

The survivor’s story really impacted me a couple years ago when I heard it.
She, a teenager from Ohio at the time she was victimized, said about
