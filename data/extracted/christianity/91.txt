...so that we may be mutually encouraged by each others faith, both yours and
mine.
[wp39de865e]
We are a group of Christians in the Meanwood area of Leeds. We would like to
introduce people to the love of Jesus Christ; equip them with a faith that
works in real life; give them the tools to duplicate this development in
others. We meet in the Meanwood Community Centre on Sunday mornings.

Anyone and everyone can come along! We particularly welcome those who are
searching for faith. We find there are many today who attended church in the
past but (for all sorts of reasons) gave it up and now find themselves asking
questions about life again. We don't promise all the answers but we do believe
that knowing Jesus Christ is the right place to start looking!

So, whether you've just moved into the area and are looking for a local church
or have been here for some time, you would be most welcome to check us out.

What is Church?
    Is it a building? Is it people? What did Jesus say? How has history
affected what we see?

Who is your Community?
   Is it about location? Is it about the group of people who meet together? Is
it more than that?
