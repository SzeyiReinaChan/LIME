                         St. Timothy Lutheran Church, Charleston, WV, places its complete
                         confidence in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Therefore, its primary
     ONLINE GIVING       concern is to proclaim through word and deed the Love of God as it is
                         given freely to all people. The Christian Life begins when a person is
                         born again into the body of Christ through baptism and a personally
  Prayer List & Chain    committed faith in Jesus Christ. It can be lived successfully only
                         through a complete dependence upon the indwelling Spirit of God.
