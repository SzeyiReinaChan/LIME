Welcome to the website of the Reformed Churches of New Zealand.

We are a federation of churches spread throughout New Zealand whose aim is to
faithfully proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ.

We believe the truth of God's word as expressed in the Holy Bible. This is
reflected in our churches' motto:

"Your word is a lamp to my feet and the light shines in the darkness."

Our understanding of the Bible is summarised in the creeds and confessions of
the Protestant Reformation, and we seek to apply the word not only to matters
of faith, but to all of life.

Please click on the icons on the left of this page to find out more about us,
and to access various resources that may be of use to you.
