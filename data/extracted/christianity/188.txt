 Weekly Biblical insight for leaders and growing Christ-followers.

                    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Outside or Inside?      
“All these evil things come from within and defile a man.” verse 23

For reading and meditation: Mark 7:14-23

Jesus is once again giving a teaching to a mixed multitude, those opposing Him,
those interested in Him, and those following Him.  Jesus had just been
challenged by religious leaders concerning their traditions centered around
washing hands before eating (when coming in from a public place).

Jesus informs the crowd that the larger matter at hand is not what might convey
unhealthy things or filth into my life (body), but the conveyance of unhealthy
things and filth from my life.  Jesus told the folks and later clarified it to
His disciples that the greater concern is what comes from the inside out, not
what comes from the outside in.From the old flesh-heart of man comes wicked
wickedness which defiles him.

The list of issues that come out of a person’s inner being are terrible and
vile.  See verses 20-22.  This is why it is so important for all
Christ-followers to realize God has given us a new heart, a born-from-above new
heart.  Though sin patterns from the old man remain, we have a new heart out of
which flows Christ’s life.  It is this life that overflows with fruit of the
Spirit.

Maximizing Leaders

Leadership development has been pointed out as the greatest need in the
churches around the world. Leadership development and disciple-making is what
God has called us to do. IMD International fulfills God's call by identifying
and coming alongside KEY indigenous Christian leaders and helping them in the
development of current and future leaders.

Do you sense God leading you to be a part of such a significant adventure? Get
in touch with me today.
