Letter from our minister: -

Jesus once said that the most important rule in life is to love God and to love
your neighbour as yourself. And when he was asked.
'Who is my neighbour?' he responded with the parable of the Good Samaritan. In
other words, anyone who is in need, even those who
our society may despise, is our neighbour.

I believe that Ashcroft Church fully demonstrates that love of neighbour in
both practical and spiritual ways. We have a full programme
of activities which caters for anyone from 1 to 101, and we play host to both
the Cirencester Foodbank and Signpost, reaching out to the
most vulnerable in our area.

We also have close links with the other churches in and around Cirencester. We
are, after all, Christians first, who just happen to worship
in different places in a diversty of traditions.

My hope is that you will experience both a love of God and a love of neighbour
within this community.

If you would like a pastoral visit to chat about a particular issue or problem
then I can be contacted by phone or email.

May God bless you, James.
