                            Welcome to Audio Bible,
                        the King James Version narrated
                        by Stephen Johnston is online!

Yes, you can listen to the entire Bible on the Internet! You can also buy Audio
Bible narrations on audio CD's, MP3 disk or as software for your Windows PC.

ROMANS 10:17-18 So then faith [cometh] by hearing, and hearing by the word of
God. But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the
earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.

Back In the forties Alexander Scourby recorded the very first narration of the
Bible. It was produced by The American Foundation For The Blind and distributed
by The American Bible Society as The Talking Bible. The Logo on the records
read "God's Word for a new age". Sixty years have passed and I would like to
present to you "God's Word for this new age." The oldest Book in the world is
now available in multimedia. Yes with Audio Bible you can listen to all 72
hours of audio on the Internet. You may ask yourself, why you need Audio Bible?
One of my friends made the point clear to me. He asked me, "tell me of one
thing your father ever wrote to you?" My mind went blank. After a few seconds
he said, "now tell me things your father told you?" My mind began to fill with
memories and his point was made. We remember better if we hear it and best if
we read along with what we hear. This is what Audio Bible is all about. For
centuries the Bible was read aloud, even when in private, remember the story of
Philip and the Eunuch?

ACTS 8:30 And Philip ran thither to [him], and heard him read the prophet
Esaias.

So sit back and enjoy reading along with Stephen Johnston's wonderful rendition
of the Bible.
