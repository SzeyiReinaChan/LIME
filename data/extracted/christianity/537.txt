Margery Kempe, Mystic
9 November 1440?
Born at Lynn in Norfolk in about 1373, Margery married and had fourteen
children. After she had received several visions, she and her husband went on a
pilgimage to Canterbury. Her fervent denunciations of all pleasure aroused
stiff opposition and she was accused of Lollardy. In 1413 she and her husband
took vows of chastity before the Bishop of Lincoln. She also made a pilgrimage
to the Holy Land. The Book of Margery Kempe, which is almost the sole source of
information about the author, describes her travels and mystical experiences.
It also shows her closeness to the passion of Christ for the sins of the world.
The last reference to her is on a pilgrimage to Danzig in 1433.

Commission of the Church of England, 1995.
