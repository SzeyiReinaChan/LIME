Welcome

Delmarva Emmaus/Chrysalis is part of a world wide Christian organization that
uses retreats, gatherings and small groups to help people of all ages and
denominations grow in their Christian faith. Emmaus events are developed for
adults and Chrysalis events are developed for youth.

Our Community serves an area (loosely!) bounded in the south by Dover, DE and
Sudlersville, MD and in the north by the MD/ PA and DE/PA state lines.
