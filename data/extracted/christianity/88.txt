Cascia Hall is a private Catholic Augustinian, college preparatory school. With
a student body of close to 525, we serve young women and men of all faiths in
grades 6 - 12. Our beautiful campus is located on 40 acres in historic midtown
Tulsa. Since 1926, Cascia has prepared students for college with a liberal arts
program committed to the Augustinian values of Truth, Unity and Love. We
educate in a community environment, focusing on academics while maintaining a
balance of spiritual, physical, emotional and psychological growth.

We hope you find our website informative. Thank you for taking the time to
visit casciahall.org

God's Peace,
Roger Carter, Headmaster

School Seal

The School Seal

The seal of the school is derived from the seal of the Augustinian Order. The
main element of the seal is the heart which is symbolic of God's Love for each
of us and the love we are called to share with each other.
