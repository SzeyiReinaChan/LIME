Students In Christ are men and women who consider themselves to be both
Christians and Students. All have ties to the Ann Arbor Church of Christ and
most attend classes at one of the local universities or colleges, or have done
so in the recent past. A few are non-student associates.

                We are an MSA recognized student group on campus that helps
Adopt-A-Highway coordinate special events and functions involving the Church
                and the University. Our goal is to promote Christianity and the
                Christian life within the Academic community.

If you have any questions or comments that you would like to direct to us as a
group, we can be reached at Students In Christ
