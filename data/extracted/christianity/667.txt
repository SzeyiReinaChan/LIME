Rector’s Welcome

[mheyd]

I’m Matt Heyd, rector of Church of the Heavenly Rest. We seek to be a loving
and open community where you can live fully—grow in the understanding of
Christ’s presence in your life, care for your neighbor, and give back from your
gifts. Questions are as much a part of our faith as answers, and we experience
God in service with our neighbors. It’s a joyful place and we have a lot of fun
together.
You are welcome. I hope that you’ll come and see.
Matt +
