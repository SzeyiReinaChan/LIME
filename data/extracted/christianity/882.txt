The Book of Hebrews
Wednesdays from 7:00-8:00pm in Room 129
Are you considering accepting Jesus as your Lord and Savior?  
Are you doubting the choice you made to believe in Jesus?
Do you want a deeper understanding of your faith in Jesus?
If you answered yes to any of the questions above, then the study of The Book
of Hebrews is for you? Expect in class to read the scriptures, study the
background of The Word, and discuss how that ancient Word matters in a modern
world. 

If you want to bring your Bible, all translations are welcome.  Nothing is
required for the class except your presence. Please contact Brian Hurt with any
questions (512-757-1234 or brianmhurt1@yahoo.com)
