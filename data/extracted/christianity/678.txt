Outstanding HSC Results. Wollondilly Anglican College on Prestigious “TOP 200
Schools” List Again

 

Congratulations to the Year 12 class of 2013 for their outstanding results in
the 2013 HSC the College has once again been ranked as one of only 5 secondary
schools from the Wollondilly Shire and surrounding districts on the Top 200
Schoolslist in NSW/ACT.

 

Alyssa Girvan, ATAR 97.15, who topped the state in Year 10 Geography, followed
her academic results through into the Higher School Certificate with Band sixes
in five of her subjects – Ancient History, Biology, Advanced English, Extension
History, and Modern History. In a year where accolades were spread across a
broad range of subject options, Eleanor Sullivan, ATAR 94.20, was awarded Band
sixes for Business Studies and PDHPE.

 

10 Band sixes (the highest band possible) were achieved among the 22 students
eligible for an ATAR.

 

Subjects to shine in 2013 included Ancient History, Design and Technology, Food
Technology, Extension History, Primary Industries and Visual Arts, where all
students achieved in the top three bands. 40% of students in the Design and
technology class at the College received a Band 6.

 

Congratulations are due to those students who were placed on the Distinguished
Achievers Merit list for NSW. All have been invited by the Mayor of Wollondilly
Shire to a special Mayor reception early in 2014;

 

  • Alyssa Girvan
  • Eleanor Sullivan
  • Joshua Hornery
  • Cameron Hunt
  • Cameron Wright

 

Of course, great results measured against external bench marks are important
and worthy of celebration, but there were smiles all round from other students
in Year 12 who gained results that represented stories of average academic
track records being converted through the hard work of staff and their own
endeavours into expanded career options.
