Welcome to our Immaculate Conception Church website and our parish family.

We are a Eucharistic community rooted in faith and gifted by God with time,
talent and treasure. Liturgy is at the heart of our faith, and our response is
love in action. We share the gift of faith through our Catholic elementary
school, religious education for children and adults and by reaching out to
those who are lonely, hungry or hurt. We invite you to join us in worship and
any of our parish ministries.

If you have any questions, suggestions or would like more information about our
parish family, please send us an email at info@celina-ic.org or give us a call
at 419-586-6648.
