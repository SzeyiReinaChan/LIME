God's work of art

  • 
        Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;
        I have called you by name, you are mine. (Isaiah 43:1)

  • 
        We are God's work of art... (Eph. 2:10)

  • 
        Thus he has given us, through these things,
        his precious and very great promises,
        so that through them you may ... become
        participants in the divine nature. (2 Peter 1:4)

the daily intention and effort to live for God alone
and not at all for ourselves."
