[INS:Readings:INS]

    Truly we are passing through disastrous times, when we may well make our
    own the lamentation of the Prophet: “There is no truth, and there is no
    mercy, and there is no knowledge of God in the land” (Hosea 4:1). Yet in
    the midst of this tide of evil, the Virgin Most Merciful rises before our
    eyes like a rainbow, as the arbiter of peace between God and man. – Pope
    Saint Pius X

    God could have given us the Redeemer of the human race, and the Founder of
    the Faiths in another way than through the Virgin, but since Divine
    Providence has been pleased that we should have the Man-God through Mary,
    who conceived Him by the Holy Spirit and bore Him in her womb, it only
    remains for us to receive Christ from the hands of Mary. – Pope Saint Pius
    X

    My hope is in Christ, who strengthens the weakest by His Divine help. I can
    do all in Him who strengthens me. His Power is infinite, and if I lean on
    him, it will be mine. His Wisdom is infinite, and if I look to Him for
    counsel, I shall not be deceived. His Goodness is infinite, and if my trust
    is stayed in Him, I shall not be abandoned. – Pope Saint Pius X

    Let the storm rage and the sky darken – not for that shall we be dismayed.
    If we trust as we should in Mary, we shall recognize in her, the Virgin
    Most Powerful “who with virginal foot did crush the head of the serpent.” –
    Pope Saint Pius X

    Holy Communion is the shortest and safest way to Heaven. – Pope Saint Pius
    X

    The collection of psalms found in Scripture, composed as it was under
    divine inspiration, has, from the very beginnings of the Church, shown a
    wonderful power of fostering devotion among Christians as they offer “to
    God a continuous sacrifice of praise, the harvest of lips blessing his
    name.” Following a custom already established in the Old Law, the psalms
    have played a conspicuous part in the sacred liturgy itself, and in the
    divine office. Augustine expresses this well when he says: “God praised
    himself so that man might give him fitting praise; because God chose to
    praise himself man found the way in which to bless God.” The psalms have
    also a wonderful power to awaken in our hearts the desire for every virtue.
    Athanasius says: “The psalms seem to me to be like a mirror, in which the
    person using them can see himself, and the stirrings of his own heart; he
    can recite them against the background of his own emotions.” Augustine says
    in his [INS:Confessions:INS]: “How I wept when I heard you hymns and
    canticles, being deeply moved by the sweet singing of your Church. Those
    voices flowed into my earts, truth filtered into my heart, and from my
    heart surged waves of devotion.” Indeed, who could fail to be moved by
    those many passages in the psalms which set forth so profoundly the
    infinite majesty of God, his omnipotence, his justice and goodness and
    clemency, too deep for words, and all the other infinite qualities of his
    that deserve our praise? Who could fail to be roused to the same emotions
    by the prayers of thanksgiving to God for blessings received by the
    petitions, so humble and confident, for blessings still awaited, by the
    cries of a soul in sorrow for sin committed? Who would not be fired wiht
    love as he looks on the likeness of Christ, the redeemer, here so lovingly
    foretold? His was “the voice” Augustine heard in every psalm, the voice of
    praise, of suffering, of joyful expectation, of present distress.” – from
    the apostolic consititution of Pope Saint Pius X on Sacred Scripture
