          Blessed Francis Xavier Seelos, C.Ss.R.

                           [seelosPortrait] elcome to the official website devoted to the heroic &
                                            miraculous life of the “Cheerful Ascetic,” Blessed Francis
                                            Xavier Seelos, C.Ss.R. (1819-1867). We hope that you will be
                                            inspired by this Redemptorist priest, who was beatified by
                                            Pope John Paul II in the Solemn Jubilee Year 2000. Father
                                            Seelos possessed great mystical gifts due to his intense
                                            prayer life. His dedication to ministry with cheerful
                                            holiness makes him still an outstanding model for clergy,
                                            religious and laity alike. As an itinerant preacher and
                                            lifelong friend of the poor and destitute, Seelos was a
                                            spiritual father to tens of thousands. Despite his early
                                            death at age 48, so profound was his missionary zeal that
                                            sickness, persecution, and even the upheaval caused by a
                                            civil war could not stop him.
