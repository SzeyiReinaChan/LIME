Knoxville First Cumberland Presbyterian Church

“Loving God, Loving People”

We are an exciting church family with people of
all ages and interests united by our common
love for Jesus Christ and our desire to grow as
God's children. Throughout the week we provide
worship, educational, fellowship and ministry
opportunities for children, youth and adults.

On these pages you'll find all kinds of
information about our church and how you can
get plugged in. Take your time to get to know
us, and then let us know how we can partner
with you in your journey of faith.

Together we'll get to know God better and
discover the great things he has done for us in
Jesus Christ. We'd love to have you join us!
