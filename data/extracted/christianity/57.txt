┃think this book is really good and helpful. I first read the online version of                 ┃
┃the book because I did not want to pay for it. But after reading a couple of                   ┃
┃program ideas and having a very very successful youth program I totally HAD to                 ┃
┃get this book. It is well worth the money."                                                    ┃
