Colleges and Universities

The 500-year-old Lutheran intellectual tradition lives on in ELCA higher
education. The 26 colleges and universities of the ELCA offer both
undergraduate and graduate education in the best of liberal arts,
pre-professional and professional education. Our schools are dedicated to the
freedom of inquiry and the development the whole person. At ELCA colleges and
universities, students are educated for a sense of calling or vocation, opening
the path toward a meaningful life of contribution to the common good through
whatever career they choose. Find yourself at an ELCA college or university.

If you are a parent or student exploring higher education, know that there is a
place for you at ELCA colleges and universities. The cost of college can be
daunting, but admissions counselors and financial aid advisers at our
institutions will help you find a way to afford a school that fits you the
best. In fact, the cost of attending an ELCA school is typically no more — and
often less — than the cost of attending most public colleges and universities,
especially since completing a degree in the normal length of time can be
difficult or impossible at public institutions. Once enrolled in an ELCA
college or university, you will discover why graduates before you have
consistently rated their educational experiences as high or higher than
Lutheran alumni of public colleges.
