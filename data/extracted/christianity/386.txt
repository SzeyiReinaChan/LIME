Relax! You don’t have to dress up. We don’t care who you voted for in the last
election. And you don’t have to pretend about anything.
You can come as you are.
Our goal is to create a place where people who don’t like church can come and
find out about faith, God, the Bible and Jesus.  Everyone is welcome here!
Whatever your story, your doubts,
your problems – you are welcome here.

                        [madras][sharpsburg3][welcome2]

 

Community Christian is a collection
of imperfect people who have a simple desire:

To reach others who are unconnected to Jesus and grow together in our devotion
to him. Look around and then come to one of our locations and join us!
