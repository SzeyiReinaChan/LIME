Passionate Worship

We look for God’s love in our lives as the evidence that we have been truly
worshipping Him. We celebrate together with high-energy music.

In-Depth Bible Teaching

We believe that practical, relevant teaching is the catalyst for transformation
in individuals’ lives. Scripture is inspired by God, completely accurate and
our authority regarding Christian beliefs and the guide for Christian living.

Unleashing Compassion

Bayside is passionate about outreach! Whether it’s collecting food and
clothing, ministering to the disadvantaged, serving seniors, fighting to stop
sex-trafficking in Sacramento and Cambodia or providing education to end HIV/
AIDS in Kenya – we’re doing it with passion.

Your Kids Will Love It

Kids are a priority at Bayside – just like they are in your home. Bayside Kids
is here to partner with families as we help kids grow in faith and character in
a setting created just for them. Just as the adult worship service has been
designed specifically for you, so has this time been created just for your
child. We want to make this the best hour of your child’s week, as well as your
own.
