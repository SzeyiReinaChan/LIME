Rector's Commentary

People of the Way

Dwight Zscheile is the author of People of the Way: Renewing Episcopal
Identity. Listen here for a deeply spiritual discussion involving the book,
which is helping us to identify where the Holy Spirit is moving around us. 

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
 

     We are an inclusive, Christ-centered community reaching out to all who
    seek a deeper spirituality and relationship with God and one another.
     

 
 

Our parishioners are multi-generational and come from a wide variety of
backgrounds. At Holy Trinity, families, children and youth are rapidly growing
in numbers. We are an open and affirming congregation centered on a common
faith in Christ. We hope you will worship with us soon.
