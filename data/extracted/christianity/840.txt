               False Teachers Revisited
                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
     This DVD is a message based on this article.

   I often receive requests to present updated false
    teachings and false prophecies by the myriad of
heretics out there.  We do try to keep up with all the
latest.  But I have to remind people that those we have
exposed as false on our site have not repented of what
 they have already done in the past, which is why they
are still on our site.  So what they are doing now has
 no relevance as to whether or not they are now to be
 considered a true Biblical teacher.  If and when they
  repent, that is renounce their false teachings and
 false prophecies, make restitution to those they have
deceived, and begin to teach sound Biblical doctrine we
will give you that information.  As of now NONE of the
 people we have exposed have repented of their Latter
 Rain, Word of Faith teachings, heretical practices or
their false prophecies.  But in the interest of helping
  you to respond to a person who inquires by saying:
 "Those articles are old and you need newer materials"
   well, here is some newer stuff you can add to the
pile.  For you and me this really makes no difference,
 but for those who are living in deception perhaps it
   might demolish one of their arguments against the
                        truth.

                 Testing The Spirits 
                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
     This DVD is a message based on this article.

Sometimes I really wonder why someone who claims to be
  a Bible believing pastor, for instance, refuses to
 listen to the truth.  It frankly boggles my mind.  I
   don't know if it is as a result of the postmodern
 paradigm or just that they have no love of the truth
  left.  I don't know how that can happen in a truly
   regenerate person.  You would think that the Holy
Spirit would confirm the truth to them, first in their
conscience, and finally through the written Word.  But
  these days it is a miracle if it gets that far.  I
don't know if their conscience has been so seared that
 they don't hear the Spirit or if they just don't want
     to know the truth because then they would be
 responsible for it.  I know that I cannot know their
motives or the reasons why they reject truth and refuse
to talk about false teaching, but I do know one thing:
 we are called as true believers to test the spirits. 
We must do this even if the result is not to our liking
          or befuddles us as to the reasons.

       1 John 4:1 Dear friends, do not believe every
 spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are
  from God, because many false prophets have gone out
                    into the world.

  Questions for Those Who Claim the "Supreme Beings"
            Of the Nations Are the True God
                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
     This DVD is a message based on this article.

I have some questions for those of the World Christian
 Gathering of Indigenous People (WCGIP) adherents such
    as Don Richardson, Daniel Kikawa, Richard Twiss
(deceased), Terry LeBlanc, Danny Lehman, Aloha Ke Akua,
 YWAM as well as many in the Emergent Church (EC) ...
the questions arise from their claim that the "supreme
beings" of the nations are all the True God, YHWH, the
God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.  You can read more on
this subject in our book "Idolatry In Their Hearts" or
 in the WCGIP section of my site. My main question for
   them is this: When did ANY of the Patriarchs and
Prophets in the Old Testament and the Apostles or Jesus
    Christ in the New Testament EVER claim that the
 "supreme beings" of the nations were Elohim/YHWH, the
one True God?  Let's look at some examples in the form
of questions and you can check out the source links as
                         well.

         How To Discern, Test & Judge Rightly

     This DVD is a message based on this article.

 In running a web site with thousands of articles, 1-2
  million hits per month from all over the world, and
 hundreds of e-mails per week, I have come to realize,
    with time, that there is a terrible problem in
     Christendom today. The problem stems from an
   existential subjective view of the world that has
filtered into the church from secular society, but also
from the teachings of heretical wolves who have taught
    an entire generation of churchgoers completely
unbiblical methods of discernment or to get rid of any
                discernment altogether.

We need a firm foundation to weather the storm of false
                         ideas
                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
     This DVD is a message based on this article.

Matthew 22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do
err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God.
                         (KJV)
Matthew 7:24 "Therefore everyone who hears these words
of Mine and acts on them, may be compared to a wise man
           who built his house on the rock.
     How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
     Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!
          (C) 1787 Joseph Funk & Robert Keene

A house built on the rock will stand.  The Rock is God
and in particular, Jesus Christ.  Therefore His written
Word is the teachings of the His Holy Spirit and a Rock
 we can depend on.  Anyone who wants to prove anything
theologically, historically, scientifically or anything
 else needs to start with correct information.  If you
   start with a faulty foundation, as you build your
 arguments, they begin to fall apart because they are
not supported in God"s truth.  If you want to build on
 a firm foundation, you need to start the process by a
careful study of God"s Word in context of the verse and
  according to the whole counsel of God"s Word.  The
      Bible is the best commentary on the Bible.

                        [karma]
               Karma (by any other name)
                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
     This DVD is a message based on this article.

               According to Wikipedia: 

 "Karma means action, work or deed; it also refers to
the principle of causality where intent and actions of
an individual influence the future of that individual. 
Good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and
    future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed
contribute to bad karma and future suffering.  Karma is
  closely associated with the idea of rebirth in some
schools of Asian religions.  In these schools, karma in
 the present affects one's future in the current life,
as well as the nature and quality of future lives - or,
 one's samsara. With origins in ancient India, it is a
 key concept in Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism,
  Taoism, Shintoism, Ching Hai and others."(emphasis
                         mine)

          Mirram-Webster defines it this way:

    the force created by a person's actions that is
  believed in Hinduism and Buddhism to determine what
that person's next life will be like: the force created
 by a person's actions that some people believe causes
      good or bad things to happen to that person

Given the definitions of "karma" above, this same idea,
 usually without the reincarnation aspect in Christian
  circles, has been taught for decades in New Thought
   movements such as the Positive Thinking/Positive

                His Name, The Only Name

Zechariah 14:9 NIV The LORD will be king over the whole
earth. On that day there will be one LORD, and his name
                    the only name.

 The reason I wrote this article based on Zech 14:9 is
 that I was reminded of how many so-called Christians,
who are influential in the churches, are promoting the
      worship of God in the names of other gods.

                      [Steroids]
           Replacement Theology On Steroids
                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
     This DVD is a message based on this article.

 So, as you can see, the root of this teaching is that
  Israel no longer holds the distinction of being the
  tree from which the Root of David (Jesus-Rev. 5:5,
22:16) came.  They are no longer the "natural branches"
 (Israel-Rom. 11:21) on to which Gentile Christianity
   (the wild shoots-Rom. 11:17 or wild branches-Rom.
 11:24) are grafted in (Rom. 11:17-24).  According to
 Replacement Theology, Christianity has now become its
own branch apart from Israel (the natural branch) that
produced the Root and all the promises of the Bible to
Israel have been taken away from them and given to the
  Gentile Church.  This is why you hear so many false
  teachers taking verses out of context from the Old
Testament and willy-nilly applying them to the Gentile
Church.  This methodology has been going on for decades
 in liberal churches and has been popularized by many
false teachers on TV. But the fact is that Replacement
 Theology is utter false doctrine.  It denies promises
    made to Israel, some of which have already been
 fulfilled and some which are yet to come to fruition.
 But when you add the fact that the Inclusivist WCGIP
proponents are now saying that God planted hundreds of
different trees, cultures all over the world, that are
not connected to the natural branch, tree and Root, you
 have what can only be termed Replacement Theology on
                       steroids!

     Those Who Do Not Lead Christians to Maturity

     This DVD is a message based on this article.

 The Scriptural definition of maturity is to learn to
discern truth from error so that the Christian will no
 longer be double minded, blown about by every wind of
teaching and by the schemes of crafty people.  But the
  problem today is that so few Christian teachers are
feeding their flock's solid food.  They are serving up
  milk and, because of that, people are starving. Yet
    they often don't even know they have been on a
  starvation diet.  Amos 8:11 "The days are coming,"
declares the Sovereign Lord, "when I will send a famine
 through the land -  not a famine of food or a thirst
  for water, but a famine of hearing the words of the
                        Lord."

     This DVD is a message based on this article.

Lying is a problem for all people (Ps. 116:11).  We are
     all sinners (Rom. 3:23).  Those of us who are
  Christians are "sinners saved by grace" (Eph. 2:8)
  indwelt by the Holy Spirit in our "new self" (Col.
  3:10). But we still live in our "old self" which we
 must "put off" (Eph. 4:20-25) by taking up our cross
daily and following Christ (Luke 9:23).  The difference
between unbelievers and those who are truly born again
is that believers no longer "practice sin" (1 John 3:9,
     see my Bible study on 1 John!)  They have the
 indwelling Holy Spirit (Rom. 8:11) who convicts them
 when they lie (John 16:8). True believers then repent
 (1 John 1:9) and go on to "practice righteousness" (1
John 2:29) with the Lord's help.  The unregenerate, the
  false brothers, or those who have fallen away (Gal.
   5:4, Mark 4:17), practice lying.  They practice a
lifestyle of lying because their consciences are seared
(1 Tim. 4:2) and the Holy Spirit, when convicting them,
cannot break through the hardness of their unrepentant
          hearts (Eph. 4:17-19, Heb. 3:13).

     Four Books That the Enemy Has Used To Corrupt
                     Christianity
                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
     This DVD is a message based on this article.

 The four books that have changed the church by giving
   an introduction to the false teachings of the New
   Apostolic/Latter Rain (NAR), the Emerging Church/
Contemplative/Catholic Mysticism (EC), pragmatic Church
 Growth (CG) methodologies of C. Peter Wagner, Robert
 Schuller and Peter Drucker, and the teachings of the
World Christian Gathering on Indigenous People (WCGIP)
                    are as follows:

  Surprised by the Power of the Spirit by Jack Deer,
 Celebration of Discipline by Richard Foster, Purpose
Driven Church by Rick Warren & Etnerity In Their Hearts
                  by Don Richardson.

  These four books were widely read by Christians from
virtually every denominational background before their
 ramifications and the movements they would spawn were
    known.  They lay error alongside truth so were
 considered not to be a threat to churches.  Therefore
 these books then became part of the consciousness of
many Christians and churches, thereby laying the basis
for the introduction of the modern day false teachings
 of the NAR, EC, CG and WCGIP that have become part of
         the landscape of Christendom today.

 With the resurgence of the old religion of Hawaii and
 the continual invocation of Pele' and other "deities"
 for years in the secular culture and even in churches
with regards to worshipping 'Io, is it any wonder that
  those beings are beginning to manifest again?  In a
story called "Night Marchers" on the Kawaihae site and
 in a YouTube video on the same subject, eyewitnesses
 claim all kinds of sightings that they think are the
  warriors, ancestors and demi-gods of Hawaii coming
   back.  Interestingly the first book the Hawaiian
  Heritage site recommends in its "Suggested Reading"
list is "Perpetuated in Righteousness" by Daniel Kikawa
that we reviewed in our book "Idolatry In Their Hearts"
  by Sandy Simpson and Mike Oppenheimer. Since Kikawa
   claims that 'Io is the True God and one that the
 Hawaiians worshipped in secret, we have to wonder if
  Kikawa also thinks 'Io is showing up in these night
 marches? Since YWAM, Aloha Ke Akua and Hilo New Hope
    participated in worshipping 'Io at the "edge of
Hale-ma'uma'u Crater" it sounds like they have all been
     inviting the old "gods" to return to Hawaii.

                  "They Will Believe
                       The Lie"
                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
     This DVD is a message based on this article.

I am doing a Bible study right now on what I would call
   "renewing our minds".  It is based on this verse:

   Romans 12:2 Do not conform to the pattern of this
world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind.
 Then you will be able to test and approve what God's
    will is - his good, pleasing and perfect will.

 The only way to renew our minds is to believe on the
Lord Jesus Christ, confess our sins, and be saved, then
to study the written Word and allow the indwelling Holy
Spirit to teach us.  Our minds are corrupted by virtue
  of the sin nature and what we have learned in life
because our filters are off. I gave an illustration of
straining coconut to make coconut milk.  If you use a 1
inch screen everything will pass through.  Even if you
 use a quarter inch screen you will get mostly coconut
 meat in your milk.  You have to use a fine screen in
  order to separate the milk from the leftover.  Our
filters are off and the first thing God begins to do is
correct our worldview, because if your worldview is off
  you will not understand God's reality.  We need to
learn to see things from His perspective.  This is why
   I started this study by going back to an original
                       problem.

 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 The coming of the lawless one
will be in accordance with how Satan works. He will use
   all sorts of displays of power through signs and
   wonders that serve the lie, and all the ways that
   wickedness deceives those who are perishing. They
perish because they refused to love the truth and so be
   saved. For this reason God sends them a powerful
delusion so that they will believe the lie and so that
 all will be condemned who have not believed the truth
           but have delighted in wickedness.

This has always been an interesting passage to me for a
   few different reasons.  What is "the lie" that is
talked about here in verse 9 and 11?  What are the ways
that "wickedness deceives those who are perishing" and
how long has this been going on or does this only begin
 to happen at the coming of the lawless one?  In what
 way does "the lie" cause those who do not believe the
           truth to "delight in wickedness"?

 "Christians" Who Try To Poke Holes In Sola Scriptura

     This DVD is a message based on this article:
 "Christians" Who Try To Poke Holes In Sola Scriptura

 There are a number of the leadership of the Emerging
 Church (EC) who do not believe that the Bible is the
highest authority for the Christian faith.  Most do not
  believe that the Bible is inerrant in the original
manuscripts and many do not acknowledge that the Bible
is our highest revelation.  Yet this is a core doctrine
   over which true believers and false brethren must
separate. Those who try to poke holes in Sola Scriptura
make excuses like (1) we need to reinterpret the Bible
through the lens of postmodern culture and religion (2)
    the Bible never uses the words "Sola Scriptura"
therefore it is not a Biblical concept (3) there is new
revelation for the church through the Holy Spirit apart
from what is written and the precepts of the Bible and
   (4) the Bible just doesn't address our postmodern
situation therefore we cannot rely on it for the truth
and answers for our problems today.  I will prove that
all the above arguments, and more, from EC leaders and
others is exactly what they are teaching.  I will give
you quotes from their teachings, videos and books. The
 postmodern church and its "movements" are abandoning
   Sola Scriptura in their rush to be like the Roman
 Catholic Church, which takes its authority from a mix
              of Scripture and tradition.

 "As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and
 interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, "does not
derive her certainty about all revealed truths from the
  holy Scriptures alone. Both Scripture and Tradition
 must be accepted and honored with EQUAL sentiments of
  devotion and reverence." (Roman Catholic Catechism,
 Given October 11, 1992, the thirtieth anniversary of
 the opening of the Second Vatican Ecumenical Council,
  in the fourteenth year of my Pontificate. Page 31).

                        [downl]
   This DVD is a message based on this article: The
                 Question Of Dominion.

I am writing this article as an apologetic against the
  Third Wave, Latter Rain, Word of Faith and Reformed
 Theology teachings that the Church is to rise up and
  take over the systems of government, businesses and
 every other aspect of life. "See, the problem is, is
 that Satan has had too much of his way in our society
   because he has a government!  And the only way to
overthrow a government is with a government.  It won't
 happen otherwise.  So therefore the government of the
  church has to get into place in the extended church
just like we do have it very well in place, we haven't
  reached our goal yet ..."  (Transcript of C. Peter
Wagner, Arise Prophetic Conference, Gateway Church, San
   Jose, CA, 10-10-2004) Wagner has substituted the
"government of the church" for the coming government of
  Jesus Christ in the Millennial Kingdom.  Wagner is
 "Kingdom Now" while the Bible teaches "Kingdom Come".
What I wanted to do with this article is put the issue
  of dominion to rest by studying the definition the
Bible gives to dominion and ruling authority.  When we
  look at the subject we can easily ascertain what is
 going on today and what God requires of the Church.

                 Shepherd Or Hireling?
                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
 This DVD is a message based on the article: "Shepherd
                     Or Hireling?"

The Bible lays out the definitions of both an overseer
 (under shepherd) and a hireling.  John 10:11-13  I am
 the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life
for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the
 shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf
coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf
 catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep. The hireling
 fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for
the sheep. (KJV)  1 Tim. 3:1-3   Here is a trustworthy
saying: If anyone sets his heart on being an overseer,
he desires a noble task. Now the overseer must be above
   reproach, the husband of but one wife, temperate,
   self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to
   teach, not given to drunkenness, not violent but
 gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. (NIV) 
Titus 1:7-13  Since an overseer is entrusted with God's
   work, he must be blameless, not overbearing, not
quick-tempered, not given to drunkenness, not violent,
    not pursuing dishonest gain. Rather he must be
    hospitable, one who loves what is good, who is
self-controlled, upright, holy and disciplined. He must
 hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been
   taught, so that he can encourage others by sound
doctrine and refute those who oppose it. For there are
  many rebellious people, mere talkers and deceivers,
 especially those of the circumcision group. They must
be silenced, because they are ruining whole households
 by teaching things they ought not to teach - and that
 for the sake of dishonest gain. Even one of their own
  prophets has said, "Cretans are always liars, evil
    brutes, lazy gluttons." This testimony is true.
 Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be
 sound in the faith. (NIV) A hireling does not really
care about being a watchman, but is more concerned with
protecting his reputation, position and income.  A true
   watchman will guard the flock against wolves from
within (Acts 20:30) and without (Acts 20:29) no matter
    the cost to his reputation, position or income.
 Following is a little quiz you can take to see if you
are a true Biblical under shepherd as a leader in your
   church, are becoming a hireling, or are one now.

                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
This DVD is a message based on these articles: Testing
Music In The Church, Testing Music In The Church-Part 2
              , and Worship Song Ratings.

 Too many churches today are allowing music to be used
 in their services that is not glorifying to the Lord
  and can actually be a hindrance to the teaching of
  sound doctrine. Pastors and leaders should be using
their leadership role to test what is being played and
 sung in their churches. Though some are quick to test
preaching and teaching from their pulpits, many ignore
 the music being used in the same services. This is a
   tragic mistake. Music is a powerful medium. It is
   something that effects deeply the body, mind and
 emotions. It is a proven fact that music often stays
    with a person far longer than what is taught or
preached. Songs roam around in our heads, especially if
 the melody appeals to us. What is often overlooked is
 the serious impression music makes on people, and the
 teaching they are getting over and over again as they
 allow the song to repeat in their minds and on their
    lips. Music teaches things much more subtly yet
sometimes far more effectively. That's why the lyrical
 content of music in the church, as well as its effect
on the spiritual lives of those who perform and listen,
  should be vigorously examined by the leaders of the
             church.  This is a 2-DVD set.

 This DVD is a message based on the articles "Examine
Yourself To See If You Are In The Faith" and "Hold On!"

2 Cor. 13:5  Examine yourselves to see whether you are
            in the faith; test yourselves.
   Do you not realise that Christ Jesus is in you -
         unless, of course, you fail the test?

   People who call themselves followers of Christ or
"Christians" and claim they are born again must believe
certain things.  If they do not then they fail the test
of faith.  They can claim they are born again all they
 want and "once saved, always saved" but if they fail
 the test of faith there is no eternal security.  Only
  God knows who will be saved, from beginning to end,
  because of His foreknowledge and omniscience (Rom.
   8:29, 1 Pet. 1:2).  God did not make an arbitrary
 judgment about who would be saved and who would not. 
    His Spirit is given to those He foreknew, when
 convicted of sin by His Holy Spirit, would choose to
believe and commit themselves to Jesus Christ.  We are
not God and we do not have His omniscience.  Therefore,
according to Paul, we must be sure our belief system is
 in the right place once our eyes have been opened to
the Truth.  I am not saying we do not have assurance of
salvation, but our assurance comes not only because of
 His Atonement and promises of salvation but from our
 continuing in the Faith, which is always the Biblical
criteria. Those who would be Bible teachers must teach
 according to the whole counsel of God's Word.  Let me
be clear. There is only one way to salvation.  That is
by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone.  I
will deal with a few of those issues following, but it
is important to recognize that being saved is not just
a matter of believing that Jesus lived, or that He was
a man, or simply giving mental ascent to His existence
                   in whatever form.

               "Blasphemizing" The Bible
                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
     This DVD is a message based on this article.

 I am going to go over an article I wrote back in 2006
     in preparation for the book I wrote with Mike
 Oppenheimer called 'Idolatry in Their Hearts'.  This
 book is an apologetic against the false teachings of
  the World Christian Gathering on Indigenous People
  movement, the Emerging Church and the New Apostolic
    Reformation which got their ideas from the book
 "Eternity in Their Hearts" by Don Richardson.  At the
time that book came out no one really saw the dangerous
 ideas Richardson was promoting.  All they would have
had to do was look at the two subtitles of that book to
understand the implications.  The first subtitle in the
  1981 edition read: The Untold Story of Christianity
among Folk Religions of Ancient People.  Those who read
 this book found some interesting cross-cultural ideas
  but apparently missed the false premise of the book
 starting with the subtitle. How could Christianity be
 "among folk religions" where the Gospel had not been
 preached (Rom. 10:14-15)? At that time Christians who
 read the book were apparently satisfied that, though
 there was some questionable material present, it made
      for an interesting discussion on how to do
  cross-cultural ministry. The subtitle it has today,
   which was first published in 1984, is as follows:
  Startling Evidence of Belief in the One True God in
Hundreds of Cultures Throughout the World.  This should
have been a red flag for many Christians but then, who
 reads subtitles?  But how could the "One True God" be
       known to Gentiles who did "not know God".

                 Resources For Pastors
                       including
           "Good English Bible Translations"
                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
     This DVD is a message based on this article.

  I was talking with a pastor after a Wednesday night
  service and he mentioned that I said I had done an
   article comparing English Bible translations.  He
   called me up later and asked me to come back and
  present the contents of that article I sent out in
  about 2002 to my mailing list for the Pacific Waves
Newsletter which, unfortunately, I can no longer afford
to publish and mail.  However an archive of past issues
of that newsletter can be found here. In that article I
detailed a number of good and bad resources for pastors
      including Bible translations, concordances,
 commentaries, Bible dictionaries, etc.  I present an
  edited version of part of that article on this DVD,
 particularly dealing with English Translations of the
  Bible.  Translation is a very detailed endeavor and
   should only be undertaken by those with a proper
    education in that subject and a sound doctrinal
background.  I read a few books on that subject and it
helped me understand the complexities involved.  Hebrew
is a rich language so it is hard to distill one Hebrew
    word down to one English word.  Greek is a very
     technical language and it is also not easy to
  translate.  This is why it is imperative to use the
  good English translations out there for comparison
 along with a good concordance and Bible dictionary.

     This DVD is a message based on this article.

 There are two kingdoms being taught in many churches
  today. Teaching about one of the kingdoms is on the
decline while the other is being promoted all over the
place.  I am warning Christians that they need to check
  out who is using the word "kingdom", the books they
   have been reading and recommend on building "the
kingdom", the people they have been hanging out with at
   conferences, and what they mean by "the kingdom".

       From Church To Emerging Church DVD Series
                   by Sandy Simpson
The issue of the Emerging Church and it's introduction
   into many churches and mission organizations has
 reached a critical point.  Many do not undersand what
is being leavened into churches by the EC leadership. 
  Many would be shocked to know their belief systems
       involve Universalism, New Age, defense of
  postmodernism, Interfaithism, and many other false
 doctrines.  In order to reach out to this generation
  the EC leadership is proposing a whole new "map" to
deal with what they perceive is a lack of understanding
on the part of the churches on how to communicate.  EC
    proponants believe the "scripture" for today is
evolving and must change in order to reach postmoderns.

          by Sandy Simpson & Mike Oppenheimer
 Does having eternity in your heart mean that you know
     God and are His child? Could Gentile cultures
 understand the Gospel from the stars? Did God create
 man's cultures? Has God always been in the process of
redeeming cultures from the time of Babel by placing in
them a true revelation of Himself? Is there the worship
of YHWH in all cultures and religions through the names
of supreme beings?  Have all cultures always had a way
   to make things right between them and God? These
questions and many more are answered in this book that
  addresses the false teachings of The New Apostolic
 Reformation regarding missiological methods as being
   carried out by many agencies including the World
  Christian Gathering on Indigenous People, YWAM, and
                 many Bible societies.

                Lessons In Forgiveness

                   by Sandy Simpson
                        [downl]
   Through the years I have been presented with many
 opportunities to forgive. Sometimes the situation was
  so severe that it took me some time to forgive and
start the process of healing for myself, and eventually
for others. I learned that a Christian needs to forgive
 other people even if they have not repented of their
sins. That can be really hard if we let it be hard. But
if we give our burdens over to the Lord, He will carry
 them and that frees us up to treat other people with
love, compassion, and be in the right frame of mind and
  heart to set them up for reconciliation with Jesus
 Christ. That does not mean we tolerate their sin. We
  simply forgive them for what they have done to us,
 whether perceived or real, and move on to looking for
 ways to redeem them. We can then present to them the
   "truth in love" even when we have to rebuke them.
