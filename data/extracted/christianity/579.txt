St John's College

Welcome to St John's College

Founded in 1909, St John’s College boasts a lively and diverse mix of students
and is like no other Durham college.

Set in a series of beautiful listed buildings in Durham's historic heart, the
College enjoys stunning views of the Norman Cathedral and River Wear.St John's
is one of the smallest colleges, and is renowned for its welcoming and
supportive atmosphere.

St John's has two distinctive yet engaged communities at its heart: a diverse
community of undergraduates, postgraduates and academics studying for
University degrees in all disciplines, and Cranmer Hall, a thriving Anglican
theological college in which people are educated and formed for church
leadership.

The College has a degree of independence within the University, both
financially and in its governance. Our students study for University degrees
alongside members of other colleges, but we have the freedom to do things a
little differently.

St John's hosts fracking and climate change conference

[Templeton1]

St John's College is hosting six conferences on fracking and climate
change. Senior church leaders across all denominations will attend to hear
leading scientists such as Richard Davies and a range of faculty staff from the
Earth Sciences Department alongside theologians such as Ruth Valerio (ARocha),
Bob White (Faraday Institute) and Cranmer alumnus Michael Roberts. The
conference is held by Rev. Prof. David Wilkinson and Professor Tom McLeish and
is funded by the Templeton Charitable Foundation.

Aegrotat degree for Pete Wake

[PeteWake]

In the autumn term, a special ceremony was held at Kings School in
Wimbledon. Pete Wake experienced head injuries in Durham City during the time
that he was a third year undergraduate at St Johns. A top historian and
outstanding rower, Pete's academic and sporting career was cut short. However
on the basis of his work up to this point, the University took the unusual step
of awarding him an Aegrotat Degree. It was conferred in his absence in summer
2015 but the Principal led a ceremony in Pete's old school close to the
hospital that he now resides in. Pete's father Phil, his mother Anne and
brother Chris were joined by a large group of family and friends in this
celebration of his achievements.
