Welcome to New Faith Baptist Church icon

We are a thriving ministry of over 7,000 members located in the suburbs of
Chicago. Our Vision is to be a people of faith who seek the heart of God
through worshipping, witnessing, and sharing the love of Christ (God’s son)
with the world. As a people of faith, we believe that faith without work is
dead. Jesus promised that those who believe on Him would do great works (John
14:12). Therefore, we at New Faith seek to advance the kingdom of God through
wondrous works of unconditional love, compassion and faith-filled action. We
have a heartfelt desire to reach those who are lost, defend the defenseless,
and equip all people to live triumphantly. Jesus has called us to go into “all
the world and make disciples.” By faith we will fulfill the great
commission-one person, one family and one community at a time.

Blessings and Breakthroughs - Rev. Dr. Trunell D. Felder & Rev. Dr. Alexis L.
Felder

Our Vision is to be a people of faith who seek the heart of God through
worshiping, witnessing, and sharing the love of Christ (God’s son) with the
world. We are a blessed people of God who are called to be a blessing to the
world. This is accomplished through our mission to live the faith through
worship, witness, and wondrous works. While seeking the heart of God through
dynamic worship, the Word of God compels us to live lifestyles of worship that
witness to the love and healing power of Christ.

Our Beliefs icon

Since its inception, New Faith Baptist Church has been more than a building, it
has been our Cathedral of Faith. This Cathedral of Faith is experienced by our
members and guests as a people coming to know Christ, and a people with a
desire to mature in their faith and impact the world of Christ. We are a
blessed people of God who are called to be a blessing to the world. This is
accomplished through our mission to live the faith through worship, witness,
and wondrous works. While seeking the heart of God through dynamic worship, the
Word of God compels us to live lifestyles of worship that witness to the love
and healing power of Christ.
