The Kingdom of God

2015 is going to be all about the Kingdom of God.

Most weeks we will focus on Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. In the famous sermon,
Jesus describes what life in the Kingdom is like.

On the first Sunday of every month we will devote the morning to the Lord's
Supper, thinking through how Jesus instituted the Kingdom.
