Our Pastor

God called the Montoya family to plant Mountain View Baptist Church in 2008. By
the grace of God, they have been faithful to Lord in establishing MVBC. Pastor
Montoya was saved at the age of 16 and surrendered to preach a few months
after. The Montoya’s met while in Bible college at Golden State Baptist College
and were married after graduation.

Pastor, Mountain View Baptist Church

What We Believe

The Bible

We believe in the verbal, plenary inspiration of the Holy Scriptures of the Old
and New Testaments and that they compose the entire Word of God. The Scriptures
shall be interpreted according to their normal grammatical-historical meaning.
We believe that God has inspired and preserved His Word, and that the King
James Bible is the Word of God. (II Timothy 3:16-17; II Peter 1:20-21)

God

We believe in one Triune God, eternally existing in three persons—Father, Son,
and Holy Spirit—each coeternal in being, coidentical in nature, coequal in
power and glory, and having the same attributes and perfections. (Deuteronomy
6:4; Matthew 28:19; II Corinthians 13:14; John 14:10, 26)

Salvation

We believe that salvation is the gift of God brought to man by grace and
received by personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, Whose precious blood was
shed on Calvary for the forgiveness of our sins (John 1:12; Ephesians 1:7;
2:8-10; I Peter 1:18-19) and that in order to be saved, sinners must be born
again.

Church

We believe that the local church, which is the body and the espoused bride of
Christ, is solely made up of born-again scripturally baptized persons. (I
Corinthians 12:12-14; II Corinthians 11:2; Ephesians 1:22-23; 5:25-27). We
recognize water baptism and the Lord’s Supper as the Scriptural ordinances of
obedience for the membership of the local church only.

End Times

We believe in that “blessed hope,” the personal, imminent return of Christ Who
will rapture of the saved prior to the seven-year tribulation period. At the
end of the Tribulation, Christ will personally and visibly return with His
saints to establish His earthly Messianic Kingdom which was promised to the
nation of Israel. (Psalm 89:3-4; Daniel 2:31-45; Zechariah 14:4-11; I
Thessalonians 1:10; 4:13-18; Titus 2:13; Revelation 3:10; 19:11-16; 20:1-6)

Morals

We believe that human life begins at conception and that the unborn child is a
living human being. Abortion constitutes the unjustified, inexcusable taking of
unborn human life. Abortion is murder. We reject any teaching that abortions of
pregnancies due to rape, incest, birth defects, gender selection, birth or
population control, or the mental well-being of the mother are acceptable. (Job
3:16; Psalm 51:5; 139:14-16; Isaiah 44:24; 49:1, 5; Jeremiah 1:5, 20:15-18;
Luke 1:44)

We believe that God has commanded that no intimate physical activity be engaged
in outside of a marriage between a man and a woman. We believe that any form of
homosexuality, lesbianism, bisexuality, bestiality, incest, fornication,
adultery, and pornography is a sinful perversion of God’s original intent for a
physical relationship between a husband and wife. (Genesis 2:24; 19:5, 13;
26:8-9; Leviticus 18:1-30; Romans 1:26-29; I Corinthians 5:1; 6:9; I
Thessalonians 4:1-8; Hebrews 13:4)

MVBC Ministries

  • Bible Preaching
  • Adult Bible Study
  • Children Sunday School
  • Thursday Prayer & Study
  • Youth Activities

We believe that the Bible is to be our sole authority in all matters of faith
and practice. It is therefore vital that we preach the Bible. On an average
Sunday morning, our church service will have some form of sermon series in
which our pastor preaches an expositional or textual sermon based on a specific
topic.

We not only have Bible preaching, but we have an adult Bible study. This Bible
study is at 10 AM on Sunday morning. We gather around a table, open the Bible,
and ask questions. We normally have a course of study, but all questions about
the Bible are welcome.

We believe that the Bible is always relevant, no matter the age. Therefore, we
have a special class for children grade levels Pre K – 6th grade. Our children
supervisor has had special training in teaching young people the Bible as well
as having a great time. This class is all 10 AM on Sunday morning as well.

On Thursday evening at 6:30 PM, we gather as a church to help bear each others
burden by praying for each other. Everyone is welcome to ask prayer for
specific needs. If a prayer request is personal, one can simply ask for an
“unspoken” prayer request. After time in prayer, we have a basic sermon based
upon a verse by verse study in a specific book.

While we are a young church, we still believe that everyone is welcome, no
matter age differences. To help accommodate such ages, we have special events
for children and teens. We host a Vacation Bible School every summer (June
16-18, 2014) for ages K5 – 6th grade. We also take our teenage group to teen
camp in July (7th-12th, 2014).
