St. Ann’s Apse Wall Mural

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

St. Ann’s Parish has commissioned the prestigious sacred artwork firm, Murals
by Jericho (http://www.muralsbyjericho.com/), to create an original work of art
that will adorn the apse wall of St. Ann’s main sanctuary. The mural will
consist of 5 separate canvases that will fill the 5 arched niches of the apse
wall to constitute a single image of Heaven.  The crucifix that currently
adorns the middle niche of the apse wall will be relocated to the white
pilaster immediately to the right altar…
