    Watering the Roots

    The future of the faith community of Fredericksburg Baptist Church is
    intertwined with the future of residents living within the Fredericksburg
    area; our contributions now will help ensure an abundant future for all.
    Just as others have tended the growth of FBC’s ministry for 160 years, it
    is now our time. May God find us faithful and diligent in preparing for the
    challenges and opportunities of the coming years.
