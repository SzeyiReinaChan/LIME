An Example of Our Services

When you visit us, expect simple, effective services designed to glorify God,
produce faith in the hearers, and encourage each one in attendance to Godliness
and faithfulness.  You will be our honored guest and warmly received by all. 
On Sundays, we begin with Bible classes for all ages at 9am.  Our well
organized and well prepared Bible classes are designed to teach the Word of God
and to promote daily Bible reading and family Bible studies.   Our morning
worship service begins at 9:50 am, with an afternoon worship service at 6 pm. 
In our worship services we sing praises to God, go to Him in prayer, partake of
the Lord’s Supper, members give back a portion of our blessings to support the
work of the church, and we hear a Bible-based and practical message from God’s
Word.  We strive to worship God in spirit and in truth, with purity and
simplicity of heart.

What Must I Do To Be Saved?

[fotw_free_]

No question is more important than this. We make many important decisions in
life regarding matters such as education, marriage, and occupation. But none is
as transcending as that which affects our soul's eternity (Matt. 16:26).
