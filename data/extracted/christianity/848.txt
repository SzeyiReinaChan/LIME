Nicolas de Grigny (1672-1703), despite his regrettably short life, was one of
the leading organ composers of his generation. His output consists of one large
publication, the Organ Book of 1699. Among its admirers is known to be J. S.
Bach, who recopied it in 1703. Grigny's organ music is the most densely
contrapuntal of any French music of that era, and this has ensured its fame.

Despite incorporating many Baroque ideas, the Organ Book looks back to the
older, more rigorous style of Jehan Titelouze (c.1563-1633), who published the
first attributed collection of organ music in France: Hymns de l'Eglise pour
toucher sur l'orgue, avec les fugues et recherches sur leur plain-chant (1623).

Unfortunately, this recording is currently unavailable (mentioned with hope).

In keeping with the style of the times, Grigny set only alternate verses for
organ, the others to be chanted. For the present recording, the Ensemble
Alternatim provides the chant verses in a re-constructed Baroque style. The
resulting integrity is admirable, and the Baroque ornaments and tempi are
convincing. The fine organ of Cintegabelle, recorded with a wonderful acoustic
and played eloquently by Bernard Coudurier, is also a feature of this
performance.

Grigny's Organ Book consists of two parts: the first is a setting of the mass
(including offertory), while the second is a setting of five hymns. The present
recording is devoted to the hymns. Many other recordings are available, most
excellent, but this one is of high merit in all aspects.
