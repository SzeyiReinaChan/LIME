Welcome to FBC Chalkville

A greeting for you…

Welcome to First Baptist Church of Chalkville’s home on the world wide web. It
is great to have you here and we hope you will find exactly what you need on
our pages to help you answer any questions you might have about our church.
Lots of people show up here first, and then meet us on a Sunday in person. We
hope you will too!

The mission of First Baptist Chalkville is to see people experience life change
because of the personal relationship they have with Christ. Therefore, we want
to know Christ and make Him known.

Our desire as a community of faith is to genuinely worship our Heavenly Father
regardless of style, equip our members for the work that He has entrusted to
us; and, to share the love and message of Christ with the world. So we are here
committed to continue our mission from the heart of northeast Birmingham.
Discover us here and connect with us in person soon! This Feels Like Home!
