Best not to depend on angels to bake your bread, as with St. Zita, but meet the
challenge yourself, and bake a loaf in honor of the "Little Cook" on April 27.

Her feast day is not on the General Roman Calendar, but is mentioned in the
Roman Martyrology (1961) for this day.

DIRECTIONS

Combine boiling water, shortening, honey, and salt; stir until shortening
melts. Cool to lukewarm. Dissolve yeast in warm water. Add yeast, eggs, wheat
germ, and half the flour to lukewarm mixture. Beat 2 minutes on medium speed
with electric mixer or 300 vigorous strokes with a spoon. Blend in remaining
flour with a spoon. Dough will be sticky. Spread dough evenly in 2 well-greased
loaf pans, 9 x 5 x 3 inches. Smooth tops by flouring hand and patting into
shape. Let rise in warm place until 1 inch from top of pans. Bake at 375° for
45 to 50 minutes or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped. Crust will be dark
brown. Remove from pans at once; brush tops with melted butter or margarine;
cool on racks before cutting. Makes 2 loaves.

York, 1965
