Bringing Together Congregations, Sessions,
Pastors and Leaders to Model Christ

Our 18 Congregations Welcome You!

[PresbyteryD]

   (open in a new window)
This week please pray for the congregation in Conrad.

Conrad is located about an hour north of Great Falls.

One way this energetic congregation reaches out to their community is by
hosting the mid-week LOGOS program which is attended by youth from throughout
their community.

Every Wednesday night the LOGOS program incorporates recreation,

Christian nurture and a family style dinner to help the youth build and
strengthen their relationship with Jesus.

Their pastor is Kirk Kestler

Their clerk is Marla Bruner
