 St Anthony’s Catholic School is a vibrant and engaging learning community
 where each person feels a sense of worth and belonging. Our school aims to
 create an atmosphere where each child is known, challenged, supported and
 encouraged to be happy and successful learners.

 We aim to develop a sense of belonging within the school, parish and wider
 community for each child.

 St Anthony’s School provides a caring and supportive learning environment
 where our professional staff encourages each student to aim high and achieve
 his/her goals.

 The self esteem of students is at the forefront of everything we do at St
 Anthony’s School. We want each student to be proud of his/her achievements
 and celebrate these with the school community.

 Our school provides educational programs, which cater for the spiritual,
 academic, social, emotional and physical development of all students in a
 contemporary learning environment.

 We aim to provide a comprehensive curriculum with a strong emphasis on using
 contemporary tools to equip every child with the necessary skills for their
 future education.

 We hope that through your involvement you and your child will come to feel
 very much part of the St Anthony’s School community.

 Damien Schuster - Principal
