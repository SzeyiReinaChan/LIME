The story of Lighthouse Baptist Church is best described by Psalm 118:23: “This
is the LORD’s doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.”

Pastor Dan Barnes and a group of 43 dedicated Christians, through the guidance
of God, formed Lighthouse Baptist church on March 3rd, 1996. This assembly of
“called-out” believers took the call of God to heart and began to work hard for
our dear Saviour. Because of the dedication of the people of Lighthouse Baptist
Church, the hand of God has been on this ministry.

While our church has become one of the largest churches in Jessamine County,
the spirit of the church family is the same as it was nearly two decades ago.
We love God and each other, and we genuinely want God to continue blessing and
multiplying the cause of Christ through our church.

Today, Lighthouse Baptist Church is a thriving testimony that God is still in
the business of changing lives! Words could not describe God’s goodness in this
place, and all the glory belongs to God! The lives changed, the families
rescued, and the victories won have all been by God’s amazing grace! To Him be
all the glory for His wonderful works at Lighthouse Baptist Church!
