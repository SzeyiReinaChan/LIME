of Susanna Wesley UMC is
to make Disciples of
Christ through loving,
serving, encouraging and
growing together.

Mark 1:4-8
4 And so John the Baptist appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of
repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
5 The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem went out to him.
Confessing their sins, they were baptized by him in the Jordan River.
6 John wore clothing made of camel’s hair, with a leather belt around his
waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.
7 And this was his message: “After me comes the one more powerful than I, the
straps of whose sandals
I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.
8 I baptize you with[a] water, but he will baptize you with[b] the Holy
Spirit.”
