Kids at MCS

Character, Competence, Community is our motto.

Our class and school rules are centered on these three words. We build Godly
character, competent children who know their qualities and understand that
within community their strengths are celebrated and their weaknesses nurtured.
We ask our students to be active members in the wider community, in sport,
music, church and social events like the 40 hour famine.

Have faith in your child’s education. We do. While our school is a state
integrated school, we are able to teach the word of God in our daily lessons.
Incorporating the wisdom of God in all we think, do and say.

Our families come from all over Wellington and attend a variety of Churches.
