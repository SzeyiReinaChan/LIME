ANDREY SHEPTYTSKY DECLARED 'VENERABLE'


[wp9884f77d]In the afternoon of 16 July 2015, Pope Francis received in a
private audience the Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints,
Cardinal Angelo Amato. During the audience, the Holy Father approved decrees
recognizing the heroic virtues of several Servants of God. The first among
these was Andrey Roman Alexander Maria Sheptytsky (1865–1944), Metropolitan-
Archbishop of Lviv-Halych. This formal declaration represents one of the
penultimate stages in the beatification process. Once a miracle attributed to
the intercession of Sheptytsky is formally recognized, Kyr Andrey will be
declared a Blessed of the Universal Church. The cause for his beatification had
been introduced in 1958. With this declaration, the "Servant of God" becomes
"Venerable" Andrey.


Prayer for Beatification of Servant of God Metropolitan Andrew Sheptytsky
O My God, I adore Your infinite Majesty with all the powers of my soul. 
I thank You for the graces and gifts which You did bestow upon Your faithful
Servant Metropolitan Andrew Sheptytsky.
I ask You to glorify him also on earth with evident proofs and miracles. 
For this end I beseech You to give me the favor, which I humbly ask from Your
Fatherly mercy.
O Lord Jesus Christ, through the intercession of Your Mother grant that Your
faithful Servant Metropolitan Sheptytsky be proclaimed a saint for the greater
glory of God, for the salvation of souls and the good of our Catholic Church. 
Amen.

HOT OFF THE PRESS!!

Announcing a New Edition of the Divine Office (Horologion) in English

Divine-Office-Flyer-PDF.pdfIn 2002 the Stamford Eparchy printed an English
translation of the original 1990 Ukrainian Molytvoslov (Horologion) of the
monks of the Order of St. Basil, the Great.  It proved to be extremely popular
among English-speaking clergy, religious and faithful, so much so that it was
completely sold out within a few years.

Today we are pleased to announce the publication of a new, corrected and
updated edition of the 2002 English translation of the Horologion consisting of
1379 printed pages.  Additions include English text under notes for singing the
services of the Paschal Triduum (Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday),
tropars and kondaks for the contemporary Ukrainian Blessed Martyrs, and propers
for the Second Sunday of Great Lent (St. Gregory Palamas).

The elegantly embossed burgundy cover will grace your bookcase and the high-
quality, sturdy binding will ensure many years of daily use.

We are indebted to Rev. Maxim Kobasuk, OSBM for the painstaking diligence with
which he corrected and updated the text, to Mr. Ihor Stasiuk for providing the
musical notation to the English text, and to Mr. Joseph Roll and others for
their expertise and help.  Please remember them when you take up this beautiful
book to pray.

Place your order by contacting the Chancery Office of the Stamford Eparchy by
telephone (203-324-7698), fax (203-357-7681) or e-mail (
vicechancellor@optonline.net)

CLERGY RETREAT 2015

Traditionally during the First Week of the Great Fast, this year from February
16-19, the clergy of the Stamford Eparchy attend their Annual Clergy Retreat.
This year the retreat master was Fr. Bohdan Kulyk, who traveled all the way
from Ukraine. Currently Father Kulyk is the pastor of St. Volodymyr Church, an
assistant pastor in the Garrison Church of Sts. Peter and Paul and a student
chaplain in the three largest universities in Lviv. Father Bohdan organized his
retreat talks around three main questions: what should we as priests expect of
ourselves, what does God expect of us and what do our faithful expect of us. In
addition, he updated the clergy with the latest information regarding the
situation in Ukraine, especially as it pertains to his role as a pastor and a
chaplain.
