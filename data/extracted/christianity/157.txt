Changepoint Church is a nondenominational congregation of Christians in
Poughkeepsie, New York. We are a city church attended by all kinds of people
from across the Mid-Hudson Valley. Our focus is on immersive worship, loving
community and practical Christian life. We’re not big on tradition and wouldn’t
know a normal person if we met one. Learn More →
