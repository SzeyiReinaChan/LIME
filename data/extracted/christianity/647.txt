Our Mission


Welcome to the Transfiguration of Our Savior Greek Orthodox Church! Located in
historic Lowell, Massachusetts, we belong to the Metropolis of Boston and are
under the omophorion of His Eminence Metropolitan Methodios of Boston. In 2014,
we proudly celebrated the 90th anniversary of the founding of our parish.


Join us for worship services each Sunday: Orthros at 8:30 a.m., Divine Liturgy
at 9:30 a.m. We welcome all visitors as we endeavor to present a compelling
vision of Orthodox Christianity to the Merrimack Valley and beyond. Please
browse our website to learn more, or contact us for additional information.


To enrich your prayer life and deepen your relationship with Christ, we invite
you to explore our online Greek Orthodox Prayer Book and listen to the Orthodox
podcasts available in our Media Room.
