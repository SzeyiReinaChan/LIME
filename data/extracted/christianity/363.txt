The United Presbyterian Church Ishpeming welcomes you.

Welcome to the United Presbyterian Church of Ishpeming!

United Presbyterian Church of Ishpeming was established on July 10, 1874 at the
first congressional meeting. Throughout the early years the congregation
averaged 50 to 60 members, which is still the standard today.

The Church Building Structure

An original wooden building was completed on November 25, 1877. In 1889 the
church rented pews to fund the building and its upkeep.

The present building structure was planned in 1904, just after the 15th
anniversary of the church, and was built in the same spot that the wooden
structure stood. The current church basement was part of the original structure
and built in the summer of 1907. The Young Memorial Chapel was added on in
1924, which currently operates as the church office.

The building features beautiful original stained glass throughout the building
and was donated in memory of past members of the church. The current organ was
installed in 1939 and boasts to be on of the most beautiful sounding organs in
the area.

The present church building is almost entirely part of the original built, with
a few improvements. A ramp was added to the front door, and an elevator
installed within the church to allow for greater mobility. In addition, the
restroom was updated to be handicap accessible.

In 2006 the church basement was given a makeover courtesy of a former church
member who contributed a lot of upkeep to the building. The large kitchen
received a huge update and is currently used weekly.

Although the congregation may be small, we continue to keep up the beautiful
historic building for over 104 years.
