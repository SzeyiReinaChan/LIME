Losers Like Us

“Christian Manuscript Submissions (CMS) is a remarkable service for first-time
authors. I had looked into self-publication but finally decided to go with CMS,
and it was the best decision I made. The CMS website really simplified the
proposal process, and Jenni's consulting expertise encouraged me every step of
the way. It seems too good to be true, but after a few months in the CMS
database my proposal was picked up by David C Cook, and Losers Like Us will be
published in June 2014. I have experienced firsthand the benefits of using CMS,
and I highly recommend it. It really does work! ”

—Dan, contracted by David C Cook for release June, 2014

Bethany House/ Baker Publishing Group signs two new authors
ChristianManuscriptSubmissions.com is a quick and easy way to find interesting
projects that probably wouldn't come across my desk otherwise. I have signed
two authors from this site over the last twelve months and continue to check
for new proposals on a regular basis.

Logos/ Kirkdale Press contracts with three new authors in 2011
[kp-logo]"We have contracted several authors through your site, and I must say
that your site is fantastic! It makes the process of finding and contacting
authors so simple. I love that I can see the author’s background and
qualifications, when dealing with certain subjects it is vital to know why the
author feels they have the wisdom and knowledge to portray themselves as an
expert on it."

[discovery-house-logo]Discovery House Publishers
"We regularly check the database on ChristianManuscriptSubmissions.com, and we
appreciate the way you help aspiring authors provide us with professionally
written proposals that give us interesting book ideas in an efficient manner.
Thank you for making our work easier.”

Harvest House Publishers
[harvest-house-publish]"With approximately 1,200 queries, proposals, and
manuscripts arriving annually, it’s a tedious task wading through them in
search of the 2% that actually fit our publishing program. That's why referring
unsolicited submissions to CMS is the most efficient, cost-effective way for
first-time authors to share their work with members of the ECPA, and for
publishers to find exactly what they’re looking for. Everybody wins.”
