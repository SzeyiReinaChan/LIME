Holy Trinity Armenian Apostolic Church

The Mission of the Armenian Apostolic Orthodox Church is to preach the Gospel
of Our Lord Jesus Christ and to proclaim its message of salvation. This mission
is realized through worship, education, witness, service and a common life in
Christ as expressed in the distinctive faith-experience of the Armenian people.
All members of the Armenian Church—both clergy and lay—are called to
participate fully in its mission.
