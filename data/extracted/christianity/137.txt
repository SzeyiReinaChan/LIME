Early life and career[edit]

Farner began his career in music by playing in Terry Knight and The Pack
(1965–1966), The Bossmen (1966), The Pack (aka The Fabulous Pack) (1967–1968),
before forming Grand Funk Railroad with Don Brewer (drums) and Mel Schacher
(bass guitar) in 1968.^[citation needed] Craig Frost (keyboards) joined the
band in 1973. Farner has Cherokee ancestry from his maternal side.^[1]

With Grand Funk Railroad[edit]

Farner was the guitarist and lead singer for Grand Funk Railroad as well as the
songwriter for most of their material. His best-known composition is the 1970
epic "I'm Your Captain (Closer to Home)".^[2] He also wrote the 1975 hit "Bad
Time", the last of the band's four singles to make the top 5 on the Billboard
Hot 100.^[3]

Post-Grand Funk Railroad[edit]

After Grand Funk initially disbanded in 1976, Farner released his first
self-titled solo album in 1977,^[4] and his second, No Frills, in 1978 (both
Atlantic Records).^[5] In 1981, Farner and Don Brewer launched a new Grand Funk
line-up with bassist Dennis Bellinger and recorded two albums, Grand Funk Lives
and What's Funk?.^[citation needed] Farner went solo again with 1988's Just
Another Injustice on Frontline Records.^[6] His third Frontline release was
1991's Some Kind of Wonderful, which featured a revamped version of the Grand
Funk classic of the same name. Farner enjoyed success with the John Beland
composition "Isn't it Amazing", which earned him a Dove Award nomination and
reached No. 2 on the Contemporary Christian music charts.^[citation needed]

In the 1990s, Farner formed Lismark Communications with former Freedom Reader
editor Steve Lisuk. Soon after, Farner began reissuing his solo albums on his
own record label, LisMark Records.^[7]

From 1994 to 1995, Farner toured with Ringo Starr's Allstars, which also
featured Randy Bachman, John Entwistle, Felix Cavaliere, Billy Preston, and
Starr's son, Zak Starkey.^[8]

In the late 1990s, Farner reunited with Grand Funk, but left after three years
to resume his solo career. He currently tours with his band, N′rG, which plays
a mixture of Grand Funk songs and Farner's solo offerings.^[7]

Farner had a pacemaker installed October 22, 2012. He had suffered with heart
troubles for the last eight years.^[9]

Other interests[edit]

Farner was honored with the Lakota Sioux Elders Honor Mark in 1999. During the
concert in Hankinson, North Dakota, a special presentation was held honoring
Mark's Native ancestry and his contributions. Members of the Lakota Nation
presented him with a hand-made ceremonial quilt.^[10] He has also been honored
with the Cherokee Medal of Honor by the Cherokee Honor Society.^[11]

An authorized biography of Farner, entitled From Grand Funk to Grace, was
published in 2001.^[12]

In popular culture[edit]

Mark Farner is mentioned by Homer Simpson in the The Simpsons episode,
"Homerpalooza", in season 7, episode 24 of the series. As Homer drives his
children and their friends to school, Grand Funk is on the car radio. The
children don't like it and ask him to change the station when he responds, "you
kids don't know Grand Funk? The wild, shirtless lyrics of Mark Farner. The
bong-rattling bass of Mel Schacher. The competent drum work of Don Brewer?"^[13
]

Mark Farner was mentioned in episode 9 of season 8 of the HBO comedy series
Curb Your Enthusiasm in September 2011.^[14]
