Standing Firm in Faith in the Scottish Episcopal Church

Responding to the Decisions on Marriage made by General Synod

July 6, 2015

cropped-Scottish_Anglican_Web.jpgAt its meeting in Edinburgh from 11-13 June,
the General Synod of the Scottish Episcopal Church chose to delete any
reference to marriage as being between a man and a woman in order to facilitate
its clergy in marrying two people of the same sex.

In contrast to that decision, we reaffirm the doctrine of marriage as given in
the Old Testament in Genesis 2:24, reaffirmed by Jesus in Matthew 19:5 and by
Paul in Ephesians 5:31 – ‘For this reason a man will leave his father and
mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.’

We are committed to loving and supporting all the people in our congregations,
including many gay people, and in particular at this time those who are left
confused and distressed by the decisions of the General Synod.

We will take some time to pray and reflect on what the General Synod has
committed to, before we discern what must be done to support people in
congregations all over Scotland who will be unable to support this innovation.

Names can be added by email to admin@scottishanglican.net. Any member of the
Scottish Episcopal Church who wishes to affirm this response is welcome to sign
it.
