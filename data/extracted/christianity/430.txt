  [            ]   "I have yet to speak on God's behalf."-Job 36:2
   [Subscribe]
                   We ought not to court publicity for our virtue, or
                   notoriety for our zeal; but, at the same time, it is a sin
[transparent] *    to be always seeking to hide that which God has bestowed
                   upon us for the good of others. A Christian is not to be a
                   village in a valley, but "a city set upon a hill;" he is
                   not to be a candle under a bushel, but a candle in a
                   candlestick, giving light to all. Retirement may be lovely
                   in its season, and to hide one's self is doubtless modest,
                   but the hiding of Christ in us can never be justified, and
                   the keeping back of truth which is precious to ourselves
                   is a sin against others and an offence against God. If you
                   are of a nervous temperament and of retiring disposition,
                   take care that you do not too much indulge this trembling
                   propensity, lest you should be useless to the church. Seek
                   in the name of Him who was not ashamed of you to do some
                   little violence to your feelings, and tell to others what
                   Christ has told to you. If thou canst not speak with
                   trumpet tongue, use the still small voice. If the pulpit
                   must not be thy tribune, if the press may not carry on its
                   wings thy words, yet say with Peter and John, "Silver and
                   gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee." By
                   Sychar's well talk to the Samaritan woman, if thou canst
                   not on the mountain preach a sermon; utter the praises of
                   Jesus in the house, if not in the temple; in the field, if
                   not upon the exchange; in the midst of thine own
                   household, if thou canst not in the midst of the great
                   family of man. From the hidden springs within let sweetly
                   flowing rivulets of testimony flow forth, giving drink to
                   every passer-by. Hide not thy talent; trade with it; and
                   thou shalt bring in good interest to thy Lord and Master.
                   To speak for God will be refreshing to ourselves, cheering
                   to saints, useful to sinners, and honouring to the
                   Saviour. Dumb children are an affliction to their parents.
                   Lord, unloose all Thy children's tongue.
