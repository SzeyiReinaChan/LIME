Fabulous Collection of Ecclesiastical/ Liturgical Vestments and Clergy Clothing

Bishop, Priest and Deacon Sets of Vestments
In this category you may find brand new Eastern Orthodox Liturgical Vestures
(Greek or Russian style). SETS OF BISHOP, PRIEST, DEACON & SUBDEACON VESTMENTS
are the distinctive garments worn by the clergy in the liturgy and the other
church ceremonies. Our Set of Priest Vestments consist of the phelonion
(chasuble), sticharion (alb), epitrachelion (stole), zone (belt-like cincture),
cuffs (epimanika), and epigonation (palitsa).

Sticharions
In this category you may find STICHARIONS (plain design, with embroidered
appliques or brocade band decorations). Sticharion (Gr. Stichar, Lat. Alb; Sl.
Podriznik) is the long white undergarment of the clergy, with close sleeves,
worn under the phelonion (chasuble) or the sakkos.

Epitrachelions
In this category you may find EPITRACHELIONS (Gr: "about the neck"; Stole One
of the most important vestments hanging from the neck down to the feet. An
Orthodox priest must wear this particular vestment to perform a sacrament. The
epitrachelion signifies the double portion of grace bestowed on a priest, for
the celebration of the Mysteries.

Under- and Outer-Cassocks
In this category you may find UNDER-CASSOCKS (Gr. Anteri, Rhason or Rason; Sl.
Podrasnik or Podriasnik; Inner Cassock; Mantija) and OUTER-CASSOCKS (Gr.
Exo-Rason or Exorasson; Sl. Ryassa or Riassa). Under- and outer cassocks are
non-liturgical robes worn by Orthodox clergy both as ordinary daily clothing
(their out-of-doors and domestic distinct attire) and underneath "liturgical
robes" (vestments which are worn during church services).

Bishop Mitres
The MITER is a traditional, ceremonial head-dress for bishops in Eastern
Orthodoxy. The crown is worn on the head during Divine Liturgy and represents
Christ the King. The MITRE (Gr. Mitra) serves as an emblem of power bestowed
upon a minister of the Church.
