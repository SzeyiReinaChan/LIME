him, “You must not take a wife from the Canaanite women,” <a class="va" alt=

land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” <a

said, “Surely the LORD is in this place, and I did not know it.” <a class="va"

Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar

the name of the city was Luz at the first. <a class="va" alt="esv_11" rel=

to the land of the people of the east. <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel=
"v01029002"></a>As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and behold, three
flocks of sheep lying beside it, for out of that well the flocks were watered.
The stone on the well's mouth was large, <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel=
"v01029003"></a>and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds
would roll the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep, and put
the stone back in its place over the mouth of the well.</p> <p id=

said, “We know him.” <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029006"></a>He said to
them, “Is it well with him?” They said, “It is well; and see, Rachel his
daughter is coming with the sheep!” <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029007">
</a>He said, “Behold, it is still high day; it is not time for the livestock to
be gathered together. Water the sheep and go, pasture them.” <a class="va" alt=
"esv_16" rel="v01029008"></a>But they said, “We cannot until all the flocks are
gathered together and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we
water the sheep.”</p> <p id="p01029008_16-1"><a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel=
"v01029008"></a><a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029009"></a>While he was
still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep, for she was a
shepherdess. <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029010"></a>Now as soon as
Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of
Laban his mother's brother, Jacob came near and rolled the stone from the
well's mouth and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. <a class="va"
alt="esv_16" rel="v01029011"></a>Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept aloud. <a
class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029012"></a>And Jacob told Rachel that he was
her father's kinsman, and that he was Rebekah's son, and she ran and told her
father.</p> <p id="p01029012_16-1"><a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029012">
</a><a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029013"></a>As soon as Laban heard the
news about Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him and embraced him and
kissed him and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things, <a
class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029014"></a>and Laban said to him, “Surely you
are my bone and my flesh!” And he stayed with him a month.</p> <p id=

alt="esv_16" rel="v01029015"></a>Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you are my
kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your
wages be?” <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029016"></a>Now Laban had two
daughters. The name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was
Rachel. <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029017"></a>Leah's eyes were weak,
<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn" href="#f5-1" id="fb5-1" title="&lt;note

</sup> but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. <a class="va" alt=
"esv_16" rel="v01029018"></a>Jacob loved Rachel. And he said, “I will serve you
seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.” <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel=
"v01029019"></a>Laban said, “It is better that I give her to you than that I
should give her to any other man; stay with me.” <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel
="v01029020"></a>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him
but a few days because of the love he had for her.</p> <p id="p01029020_16-1">
<a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029020"></a><a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel=
"v01029021"></a>Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife that I may go in to
her, for my time is completed.” <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029022"></a>
So Laban gathered together all the people of the place and made a feast. <a
class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029023"></a>But in the evening he took his
daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob, and he went in to her. <a class="va"
alt="esv_16" rel="v01029024"></a>(Laban gave<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn"

servant Zilpah to his daughter Leah to be her servant.) <a class="va" alt=
"esv_16" rel="v01029025"></a>And in the morning, behold, it was Leah! And Jacob
said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for
Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?” <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel=
"v01029026"></a>Laban said, “It is not so done in our country, to give the
younger before the firstborn. <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029027"></a>
Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return
for serving me another seven years.” <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel=
"v01029028"></a>Jacob did so, and completed her week. Then Laban gave him his
daughter Rachel to be his wife. <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029029"></a>
(Laban gave his female servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her
servant.) <a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel="v01029030"></a>So Jacob went in to
Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another
seven years.</p> <h3 id="p01029030_16-1"><a class="va" alt="esv_16" rel=

When the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb, but Rachel was
barren. <a class="va" alt="esv_18" rel="v01029032"></a>And Leah conceived and
bore a son, and she called his name Reuben,<sup class="footnote"><a class="fn"

said, “Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction; for now my husband will

when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it, <a class="va" alt=

bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before he dies.” <a

mother, “Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man. <a
class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01027012"></a>Perhaps my father will feel me, and
I shall seem to be mocking him and bring a curse upon myself and not a

him, “Let your curse be on me, my son; only obey my voice, and go, bring them

put them on Jacob her younger son. <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01027016">
</a>And the skins of the young goats she put on his hands and on the smooth
part of his neck. <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01027017"></a>And she put

am Esau your firstborn. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my

when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau
his brother came in from his hunting. <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel=

And he said to his father, “Let my father arise and eat of his son's game, that
you may bless me.” <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01027032"></a>His father
Isaac said to him, “Who are you?” He answered, “I am your son, your firstborn,
Esau.” <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01027033"></a>Then Isaac trembled very
violently and said, “Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and
I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him? Yes, and he shall be
blessed.” <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01027034"></a>As soon as Esau heard
the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry
and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!” <a class="va"

Esau, “Behold, I have made him lord over you, and all his brothers I have given
to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then
can I do for you, my son?” <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01027038"></a>Esau

in Gerar. <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01020002"></a>And Abraham said of
Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took
Sarah. <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01020003"></a>But God came to Abimelech
in a dream by night and said to him, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the
woman whom you have taken, for she is a man's wife.” <a class="va" alt="esv_04"

have done this.” <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01020006"></a>Then God said
to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you have done this in the integrity of
your heart, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore I did
not let you touch her. <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01020007"></a>Now then,
return the man's wife, for he is a prophet, so that he will pray for you, and

all these things. And the men were very much afraid. <a class="va" alt="esv_04"

and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me things that ought not to be
done.” <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01020010"></a>And Abimelech said to
Abraham, “What did you see, that you did this thing?” <a class="va" alt=

is no fear of God at all in this place, and they will kill me because of my
wife.’ <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01020012"></a>Besides, she is indeed my
sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she
became my wife. <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel="v01020013"></a>And when God
caused me to wander from my father's house, I said to her, ‘This is the

Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him. <a class="va" alt="esv_04" rel=

this slave woman shall not be heir with my son Isaac.” <a class="va" alt=

to Abraham, “Be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave

your offspring be named. <a class="va" alt="esv_13" rel="v01021013"></a>And I
will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your

putting it on her shoulder, along with the child, and sent her away. And she
departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.</p> <p id=

the child under one of the bushes. <a class="va" alt="esv_13" rel="v01021016">
</a>Then she went and sat down opposite him a good way off, about the distance

she sat opposite him, she lifted up her voice and wept. <a class="va" alt=

went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink. <a class="va" alt

lived in the wilderness and became an expert with the bow. <a class="va" alt=

Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock apart. <a class="va" alt="esv_17" rel=

Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood. <a class="va" alt=
