mlk_8834cWhidbey MLK Community  Event
At 1:00 on Martin Luther King Day (Monday, January 18) St. Augustine’s
Episcopal Church (Freeland) will again host a celebration of the nonviolent
leadership and witness of Dr. Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement.
more info
The event will be preceded by a free lunch (12:00 to 12:45) in Campbell Hall.
(Yes, there is a free lunch!!). The theme of this year’s event is the inclusive
“Beloved Community.” A community where the spirit of sisterhood and brotherhood
reign and where bigotry, racism and all forms of discrimination are not to be
tolerated. At the core of Dr. King’s vision of a Beloved Community is love and
reconciliation. The event will feature interactive readings reflecting on the
Beloved Community of the 1960s and a Beloved Community still found today among
contemporary issues. Afro-American Gospel and Movement music led by Karl Olsen,
as in  past years, will continue to be a vital element of the service. The
event is sponsored by the St. Augustine’s Episcopal Peace Fellowship.


MLK speech video Friday, January 15, 7pm in the LUMC Fellowship Hall
In honor of the MLK holiday the LUMC Mission/Church and Society Committee and
the Whidbey Island Fellowship of Reconciliation are sponsoring a 60 minute
Tavis Smiley PBS special featuring MLK’s courageous “Beyond Vietnam: A Time to
Break Silence” speech delivered on March 4, 1967, in NYC, exactly one year
before his assassination.  MLK’s  prophetic “Beyond Vietnam” speech is as
challenging, relevant and powerful now as it was then.
