  Storybook         St. Peter was the prince of the apostles and the first pope.
  _                  Jesus said to him, "You are Peter, and on this rock I will
  Aesop's          build my church" (Matthew 16:18). The name 'Peter' means rock.

  _                   After Jesus went back to heaven, St. Peter preached the
  Questions         Gospel. He guided the small but growing Christian community.
  Kids Ask          At first, Peter worked hard in Jerusalem and in Antioch, two
  _                big cities of the east. Later, he went to preach the Gospel in
  Pets 4 Us                       Rome, the capital of the world.

  The Game Room      How would Peter carry out his great mission for the Lord?
  _                 Jesus, his Master had been crucified but then had risen from
  Arts 'n'                       the dead. Who would believe that?

  _                  The evils of the Roman Empire that did not believe in the
  Things2Make       living God would drown his voice no matter how dedicated he
  _                                           may be.
  Saint of the
  Day              But the Holy Spirit was alive in Peter. He boldly took up the
  _                ministry Jesus had given to him. Never again would Peter deny
  Crosswords           his Lord. Never again would Peter put his own personal
  _                          well-being before the good of the Church.

  _                  The feast of St. Peter's Chair at Rome reminds us that St.
  Word Finder         Peter started the Christian community in that city. The
  _                 special chair is a symbol of the authority that was given to
  Coloring          him by Jesus. Kings of old sat on thrones and ruled. Peter's
  Pages              chair is a symbol of his authority from Jesus to rule the
  _                                           Church.
  The Funny
  Bone             St. Peter was put to death and died a martyr for his faith in
  _                   Jesus, but down through the ages there has always been a
[crv_bluedrk_btm]     bishop of Rome. He is the pope. The pope rules the whole
                       Church, as St. Peter did, in Jesus' name. We call the
                              successor of St. Peter the Holy Father.
