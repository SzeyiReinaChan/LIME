                      A community of joy – gathered
                      around word and sacrament -
                      celebrating, learning & sharing the
                      love of God in Christ Jesus!

                      Adult Bible Class: “The Grave
                      Robber”
                      Starting January 10, 10:45 am

                      Grave robbers typically get a bad
                      name, disturbing resting bodies
                      with their nighttime raids. But did
                      you ever consider that Jesus was a
                      “grave robber”? He was one who
                      robbed the grave of its prey,
                      actually on several occasions. In
                      his gospel writing, John pictures
                      Jesus as the ultimate grave robber.
                      In particular, John tells how Jesus
                      robbed the grave of the body of
                      Lazarus – and of course, of His own
                      dead frame as well. Such actions
                      tell us a good deal about the
                      person of Jesus – and about His
                      intention for our lives.

                      During this study of St. John’s
                      gospel, we will examine the seven
                      “signs” that John uses to picture
                      Jesus’ life and ministry, as well
                      as the culminating “ultimate sign”
                      of His own resurrection. That sign
                      calls each of us to pay close
                      attention to Jesus’ teaching and
                      especially to His call to follow
                      Him as His disciple.

                      Join us on Sunday mornings,
                      beginning January 10, at 10:45 AM
                      (following our worship service) for
                      this study that promises to unleash
                      the gospel message in some new and
                      amazing ways among us. Some
                      “lead-in” videos by Mark Batterson
                      will help to kick off our
                      conversations. But our primary text
                      will be the Scriptures themselves.
                      Come, learn, and grow to know Jesus
                      a bit better – it will help you to
                      share Him more eagerly.             ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓

                      co-author of a new book about the
                      ancient city of Hippos in Israel,
                      where he has excavated for years.

                      The First Twelve Seasons of

                      pages, $130) describes an ancient
                      city on a low mountain overlooking
                      the Sea of Galilee in northern
                      Israel, the area in which Jesus
                      began his ministry. Hippos, also
                      called Sussita, flourished through
                      Greek and Roman phases before
                      finally becoming an important
                      center for early Christianity. It
                      was destroyed in an earthquake in
                      about A.D. 750.

                      support each other in tough times,
                      pray together and throw great
                      parties.

                      If you have a busy schedule, it's
                      OK to come when you can — or you
