Welcome to the website of Our Lady of Good Counsel Parish, a parish of the
Archdiocese of Glasgow.

I was delighted to be appointed Parish Priest of Our Lady of Good Counsel in
September 2014, after having served as Parish Priest of St Paul&apos;s,
Whiteinch for four happy years. Previous to this I was a curate in St Ninian&
apos;s, Knightswood, and in St Mary&apos;s, Duntocher. I have also served as
Chaplain in St Andrew&apos;s and St Thomas Aquinas Secondary Schools.

If you are new to the parish, or simply passing through, please say hello and I
&apos;m sure you will find just as warm a welcome as I did on my arrival.

For Catholics, marriage is a relationship and a spiritual bond between a man
and a woman that plays a key role in the definition of Christian families; a
sign of God&apos;s undying love for us.

Our parish has a programme to help couples prepare for marriage, an essential
part of your preparations.

The Archdiocese also offers a programme to support parish preparation. Speak to
the Parish Priest for more details.
