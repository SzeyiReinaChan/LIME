Welcome to Maranatha Baptist Church!
Whether you are searching for truth, beginning your walk with God, or have
followed Jesus Christ for many years, you will find others like you at
Maranatha Baptist Church.  God has given us a beautiful facility here in the
community of Yorktown, VA, but our church is not a building.  Maranatha Baptist
Church is people – people just like you.

Our church offers a wide variety of activities designed to draw you closer to
the Lord and to others who are pursuing Him. We hope you’ll stop by soon.  We’d
love to meet you, and we invite you to join our church family in seeking the
Creator with all your heart.
