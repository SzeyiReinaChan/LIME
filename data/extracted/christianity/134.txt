   “What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
          By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?”
                                (Romans 6:1-2)

About our church...
Our denomination traces its lineage to the original Presbyterians of Scotland,
and is often referred to as the Church of the Covenanters.
It had its visible birth in the Reformation Days of Scotland and came to
America around the time of the Revolutionary War.

Our congregation is located about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh in the western
Pennsylvania town of Beaver Falls near the Ohio border. We are dedicated to
glorifying and serving God, and to knowing Him better and better through Christ
His Son who lived, died, and rose so that all who turn to and believe in Him
will be saved.

The Reformed Presbyterian Church is founded upon the conviction that the Bible
is the Word of God.

  • We believe that it is infallibly inspired and given for our guide to our
    beliefs and daily lives.

  • We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is the foundation stone of the
    church, the divine Son of God and our only salvation from sin.

  • We believe that God is Sovereign, in personal salvation and over every
    realm of life.


Our Purpose:
The purpose of our church is to help people find the answers to some of life’s
hardest and most puzzling questions like:

  • Who am I?

  • Where did I come from?

  • Where am I going?


Everyone is WELCOME!
