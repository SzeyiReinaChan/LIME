The Divine Shepherd

Category: God's Protection

The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
He makes me lie down in green pastures;
he leads me beside still waters;
he restores my soul.
He leads me in right paths
for his name’s sake.

Even though I walk through the darkest valley,
I fear no evil;
for you are with me;
your rod and your staff-
they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me
in the presence of my enemies;
you anoint my head with oil;
my cup overflows.
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
all the days of my life,
and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord
my whole life long.

Psalm 23
A psalm of beauty and peace, often heard at a funeral.
May I draw comfort from the psalm as I think of those whom I have loved and
lost.
May I trust them to God
To God’s care.
And so trust myself too
To the divine shepherd
Who leads me through life
And into the valley that comes at the end.
