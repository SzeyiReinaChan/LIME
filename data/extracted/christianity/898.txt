WELCOME ALL | WORSHIP GOD | WITNESS TO THE WORLD

Here at Porterfield Church our mission is simple. Welcome All , Worship God ,
Witness to the World . We believe that in those three phrases we are living out
what God has called us to do and how He has called us to live. We welcome
everyone with open arms, no matter where they are in life. 

one church | three services

ONE CHURCH | THREE SERVICES

Although Porterfield is one church unified together with a common cause and
goal, we live out our vision by offering three service times and two service
types. Having both a traditional and contemporary service style available
allows us to reach a variety of people and serve the needs of our changing
community. 


Each service type has a unique meeting time, so be sure to check out a service
 that fits you best and join us for a weekend experience!


8:30 & 11 AM Traditional Worship


915 Worship-915 is more than just the time for our Contemporary Worship
Experience here at Porterfield. 

  • When the whole crowd saw him, they were immediately overcome with awe, and
    they ran forward to greet him. 

Mark 9:15


This service is packed with excitement and energy! 915 Worship offers the best
of praise and worship that bridges the gap between all generations, cultures,
and styles of worship. In this relaxed and casual atmosphere you will find
yourself right at home.
