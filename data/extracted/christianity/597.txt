Where is St John's?

Welcome

to St John's Anglican Cathedral, Brisbane

St John's Cathedral is home to a community which seeks to bring the best of
Anglican tradition into dialogue with the issues and needs of our day.

We strive for open-minded conversation, seek to practice inclusion, and reflect
on how we might see our beliefs put into action. We want this to be a place
where people are encouraged to seek God and progress their own spiritual
journeys.

The cathedral itself, a renowned Brisbane landmark, serves as a magnet, where
diverse people gather to worship, celebrate, seek solace, converse and learn.


Peace,
Peter Catt
Dean of Brisbane

Reflections

In water we grow,
secure in the womb,
and speechlessly know
love's safety and room.
Baptizing and blessing
we publish for good
the freeing, caressing
safe keeping of God.
