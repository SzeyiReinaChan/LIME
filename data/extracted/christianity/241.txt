This is the new version of our website, "proudly powered by Word Press," and
hosted by The GraceNet. It  may look a little different; but, we hope you will
find it improved. There is no more scrolling through the links in the Q & A
Archives to randomly find the answer. The Question and Answer articles have
been categorized into approximately 40 categories, A to Z. If you want to  know
what they are, click on the main link labeled Q & A Table of Contents in the
column on the left.  This is a listing of all the Categories cross-referenced
to the "old" archive numbers. When you find the category you want, click on the
link, and, it will take you to one of the six Bible Question and Answer
Archives. There is also a main Archive Category List.  If you do not find what
you are looking for, please take a minute to use the Search Link, the "green
magnifying glass" located upper right. Your answer may already be there. If
not, email me at Dr. Max D. Younce.

Please feel free to take advantage of our Bible Study Resources: the drop-down
link in the top menu which features all available books in pdf format;
including those of Dr. Max D. Younce, Dr. Mark G. Cambron, Dr. A. Ray Stanford,
Michael P. Bowen, and other valuable Bible Study Resources which you may read
free online. Also found on the "Books by Dr. Max D. Younce" page are the pdf
files for "The Resurrection" and "Exposition on Romans 10:9,10."

This is a ministry of Heritage Baptist Bible Church. We think our church is a
friendly church and our hallmark is Bible-centered, verse-by-verse preaching,
always including the clear Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.

What is the Gospel, you may ask...

"Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you,
which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; By which also ye are saved,
if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that
Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; And that he was buried,
and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:" - 1
Corinthians 15:1-4

Christ Died, That's History. Christ Died for Me, That's Salvation!

WE ARE DEEPLY GRATIFIED BY THE MAIL WE HAVE RECEIVED; but, if you have emailed
recently and not received a response, please bear with us. REST ASSURED, your
questions and comments are very important to us! We read them all, and some of
the answers will be the subject of future articles. So, please keep them
coming.

This web site's sole purpose is teaching the Word of God.  As time permits, we
feature a new Question & Answer Article.  Please visit our exhaustive Archive
of Answers to Bible Questions on many subjects.
