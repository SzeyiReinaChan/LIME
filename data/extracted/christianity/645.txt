Welcome to Hallal Worship! We are a music ministry dedicated to providing
worship resources. Over the last 20 years, God has blessed us with
opportunities to spread his message through song. We pray that God uses this
new website to reach even more people and churches throughout the world.

We’re really excited about the new features and the easy navigation of
HallalWorship.com. Individual songs, along with their sheet music, are now
available to download. You can also find a song or album with the Song Search
by typing in a title, lyric, or even an author. Check out the Free Downloads
section for various songs, sheet music, and videos.
