                                     Healing Word Psychotherapy Services, LLC,
                             focuses on the healing that the Lord Jesus Christ
                             desires to do in an individual’s life. For Jesus
                             Himself said, "Apart from me, you can do nothing"
                             (John 15:5).  But He has chosen to let us partake
                             in the healing process. As the Apostle Paul said,
                             "But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show
                             that this all-surpassing power is from God and not
                             from us" (2 Corinthians 4:7). Therefore, it is the
                             basis of Healing Word Psychotherapy Services that
                             God is the Almighty Healer. God is the only One who
                             can give life, for God is the Author of Life. His
                             life is given through the speaking of His Word. As
                             the centurion replied to Jesus in Matthew 8:8,
                             "Just speak the Word, and my servant will be
                             healed."

                                       Jesus Christ is the Anointed One of
                             Isaiah 61, who came to "preach the good news to the
                             poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim
                             liberty to the captives, and freedom to the
                             prisoners." Since the Bible tells us that Jesus
                             Christ is "the same yesterday, today, and forever"
                             (Hebrews 13:8), whatever has broken your heart,
                             whatever present troubles you’re struggling with,
                             whatever emotions, beliefs or hurtful memories have
                             held you captive, whatever ungodly spiritual ties
                             have bound you, Jesus can free you from your pain
                             so that you, too, can say with the Apostle Paul,
                             "…forgetting those things which are behind, and
                             reaching toward what is ahead, I press on toward
                             the goal to win the prize for which God has called
                             me heavenward in Christ Jesus" (Philippians
                             3:13-14).

                                     At Healing Word Psychotherapy Services,
                             you’ll find a compassionate, caring and respectful
                             Christian approach which addresses the entire
                             spectrum of mental health issues, from depression
                             to eating disorders to schizophrenia. Healing Word
                             looks at every aspect of the individual –
                             emotional, psychological, social, physical
                             (non-medical), with a special emphasis on the
                             spiritual. Healing Word holds a sensitively
                             integrated perspective on mental health issues and
                             disorders, drawing from spiritual truths found in
                             scripture as well as sound psychological
                             principles. Healing Word values each individual as
                             a unique person of worth - created in Christ’s
                             image - not as a psychiatric diagnosis or label.
                             Along with conventional treatment interventions
                             such as cognitive-behavioral principles, Healing
                             Word also provides specialized approaches used in
                             therapy with clients, including but definitely not
                             limited to: healing prayer; a spiritual experience
                             inventory; and a focus on a person’s identity,
                             value and worth in Christ and how to live this out
                             in daily life. (For a more comprehensive listing of
                             Healing Word’s specialty areas, please see Issues
                             Addressed.)

                             about the healing Christ desires to do in an
                             individual’s life, in whatever manner or timing He
                             chooses to do that healing. It is God’s desire that
                             all of His children be restored and made whole, and
                             live their lives to their fullest potential in Him.
