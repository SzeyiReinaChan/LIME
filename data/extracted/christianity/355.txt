                        Manuel Nevado Rey
                        Manuel Nevado Rey:
                        Healed by Escriva

                        Many of the pilgrims attending the
                        ceremony were from the new saint's
                        homeland of Spain, but others came from
                        Latin America, where Opus Dei has
                        strongly taken hold.

                        Spanish doctor Manuel Nevado Rey, whose
                        recovery from a radiation-caused skin
                        disease is considered a miracle
                        performed by Escriva, was among the
                        crowd.

                        "My hands started to improve and look
                        better, while before I didn't show them
                        to other people for how horrible they
                        were," Mr Nevado told the Associated
                        Press.

                        Medical experts consulted by the
                        Vatican said there was no scientific
                        explanation for the transformation.

                        Growing influence

                        The progression of Escriva to sainthood
                        has been rapid.

                        He was beatified, or made blessed, in
                        1992, and his canonisation was approved
                        last year.

                        Josemaria Escriva
                        de Balaguer
                        Escriva: Fast track
                        to sainthood

                        The group's strict adherence to the
                        church's teachings has allowed it to
                        flourish under the current papacy,
                        which promotes traditional values.

                        Pope John Paul II has already appointed
                        one of the group's members as his
                        spokesman, and has also chosen a
                        cardinal from its numbers.

                        Some members choose to remain celibate,
                        donate their salaries to the
                        organisation, and live in Opus Dei
                        centres, where men and women are
                        segregated.

                        They practise "self-mortification" -
                        including fasting and flagellation - as
                        a way of reminding themselves of how
                        Christ suffered.

                        The group, which has 80,000 members in
                        80 countries, is thought to have
                        considerable political and financial
                        influence, particularly in Spain where
                        its followers are concentrated.
