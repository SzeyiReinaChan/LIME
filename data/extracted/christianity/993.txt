We welcome you with loving hearts. We are a respite from the chaos and "stuff"
of the world. We find comfort in God's Word and healing in prayer. We grow in
faith together and find strength in service to others. Join us at the table to
receive God's sacrament where the only prerequisites are an open heart and an
open hand. Connect through small groups. Have fun by participating in our many
congregation and community events.
