Assumption College is a Catholic, year 7 to 12 co-educational, day and boarding
school in Kilmore, Victoria founded by the Marist Brothers in 1893.

Our students are encouraged to be curious and to continually develop their love
of learning. Our motto, Quae Supra Quaere, calls us all to seek the things that
are above.

There are five characteristics of Marist education that our staff and students
are asked to embrace: presence, simplicity, family spirit, love of work and in
the way of Mary.
