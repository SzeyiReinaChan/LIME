KATERI'S HOME 

Kateri painting

Kateri lived here in Caughnawaga (“By the Rapids”) from 1666, when she was ten
years old, until 1677, when she fled to Kahnawake, a Christian village in
Quebec, Canada. (The northern settlement’s name is the same as Caughnawaga,
just spelled differently). This village, across the St. Lawrence River from
Montreal was called “The Village of the Praying Indians.”

The original Caughnawaga, here in present day Fonda, NY, is the site of the
village or “castle” where Kateri lived most of her life. It is the site of the
only fully excavated Mohawk village of that era. Nearby, the holy spring, whose
water was used to baptize her, still flows here. Many pilgrims claim cures
after drawing its crystal clear water and praying through the intercession of
Saint Kateri.
