Bible Study
Bible StudyBible study is the core of our Craig Seventh-day Adventist Church
because Bible study is transformational. All Scripture is given by inspiration
of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete,
thoroughly equipped for every good work. Timothy 3:16-17
You Shall Flourish
You Shall Flourish"The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, He shall grow
like a cedar in Lebanon." (Psalm 92:12) NKJV
Rejoice in the Lord
Rejoice in the Lord"Rejoice in the Lord, O you righteous! For praise from the
upright is beautiful." (Psalm 33:1) NKJV
Children's Ministry
Children's MinistryThe Children’s Ministry of Craig Seventh-day Adventist
Church exists to glorify God through evangelizing children, encouraging
parents, and edifying servants so that the gospel may be spread among our
children, families may be supported, and the church may be strengthened.
 
 
 
 

My Whole Life

I was born to reflect the image of a God who is powerful enough to create my
universe, attentive enough to hear my prayers and loving enough to be defined
by self-sacrifice. I find my greatest fulfillment on a journey toward purpose
and wholeness.

[ico-tri] SpiritualityMy God loves without restraint... [ico-heart] VitalityMy
Life is a gift to be valued... [ico-networ] ServiceMy World is a place where
people find hope...
