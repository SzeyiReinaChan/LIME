Specific Q&A

 

We're looking forward to seeing you this Sunday,

January 10, 2016!

All our Sunday School classes will be studying the course "The Call" by Adam
Hamilton.  After the first session, it was fun to hear all the different
conversations!  The sermon is titled "Make Disciples."  This is the second part
of a look at Jesus' stories told in Matthew 25.  We will be looking at "The
Parable of the Talents" in verses 14 - 30.  It is an annual tradition at Lost
Creek to consider these stories on the first three Sundays of each year.  

Sunday evening, at 6:00, Lost Creek will host the annual Perkins Ministerial
Alliance "Thanks For Giving" service.  This time of worship and fellowship is
lead by the pastors of the Perkins community.
