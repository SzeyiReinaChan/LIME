Keeping Kids Engaged in the Class: The Logical Learner

Keeping Kids Engaged in the Class: The Logical Learner

January 7, 2016 By Lindsey Leave a Comment

Welcome to post #7 in the Engaging Kids in the Classroom through Learning
Styles series. Today, we’ll be discussing the logical learner. The logical
learner is very good at reason and numbers. Their brains work almost like
computers making numerical patterns out of almost any information.  A logical
learner can recognize patterns easily, as well as connections between seemingly
meaningless content. They love to classify and group information to help
understand it If you missed a post or two, … [Read more...]

Keeping Kids Engaged in the Classroom: The Verbal Learner

January 4, 2016 By Lindsey Leave a Comment

Welcome to post #6 in the Engaging Kids in the Classroom through Learning
Styles series. Today, we’ll be discussing the verbal learner.  Verbal learners
love words  -- writing, reading, and  rhyming.  Also called a linguistic
learner, this student delights in creating and interacting with language. In
Your Weekly Routine Weekly Journal:  Many teachers include a “daily journal”
time for the students.  This would be a great practice in the Sunday school
classroom as well.  Provide … [Read more...]

Keeping Kids Engaged in the Classroom Through Movement

January 1, 2016 By Lindsey Leave a Comment

Welcome to post #5 in the Engaging Kids in the Classroom through Learning
Styles series.  Today, we'll be discussing the Kinesthetic learner. The
Kinesthetic learner loves to touch and feel the things she is learning about. 
Also called a tactile learner, this type of student loves moving and using her
hands as she learns in the classroom.  Any activity that involves whole body
movement is ideal, but even small movements will help to keep this type of
learner involved.  Here’s a few ideas … [Read more...]

Engaging Kids in the Classroom: The Visual Learner

December 28, 2015 By Lindsey Leave a Comment

Welcome to post #4 in the Engaging Kids in the Classroom through Learning
Styles series.  Today, we'll be discussing the visual learner. The visual
learner loves to see what he is learning, especially when the visual includes
pictures or moving images.   This is a pretty natural learning style for most
teachers to teach to– we usually love writing on boards and making posters.  Of
course, there’s always room to step it up a notch.  Something as simple as
writing in multiple colors of markers … [Read more...]

Engaging Kids in the Classroom: Auditory Learner

Engaging Kids in the Classroom: Auditory Learner

December 23, 2015 By Lindsey Leave a Comment

Welcome to Post #3 in the Engaging Kids in the Classroom through Learning
Styles series. The first type of learner we will look at is the auditory
learner.   Lecture-style teaching is great for an auditory learner, but there
are plenty of other ways to engage this student.  Auditory (or aural) learners
love to hear what they are learning.   Music, sound effects and even changing
the volume of your own voice will go a long way in teaching this type of
learner. In Your Weekly … [Read more...]

Engaging Kids in the Classroom through Learning Styles: What’s it All About?

December 21, 2015 By Lindsey Leave a Comment

Welcome to Post #2 in the Engaging Kids in the Classroom through Learning
Styles series.  You may be wondering, “What is a learning style anyway?” I’m so
glad you asked! A learning style is a person’s preferred method of gaining
knowledge. You may have heard phrases such as “visual learner” or “auditory
learner” thrown around before – both of these are common types of learning
styles. However, there are a few more you should add to the list. The seven
most common learning styles … [Read more...]
