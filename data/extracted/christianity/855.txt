               The Hebrew Scriptures: Books of the Old Testament

It will serve now to list in comparable columns the canons of the Old Testament
as accepted by both Roman Catholics and Protestant Evangelicals. Jews have the
same canon as Protestants.

The lists are divided into the groups as taught by the respective faith groups.
The books with asterisks are those of the Roman Catholic canon which are
considered canonical, but are labeled apocryphal by Protestants and
Evangelicals.
