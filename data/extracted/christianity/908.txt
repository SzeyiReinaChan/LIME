Welcome 

 

Welcome to the website of Narellan Anglican Church. 

 

We are people who have discovered that God has forgiven us and given us eternal
life through Jesus' death and resurrection. As a result, we now follow and
serve the Lord Jesus.

 

Just what is Christianity about? Does it matter if I believe? Isn't
Christianity just like other religions? When we die, isn't that just the end?

If you would like to learn more, please contact us and we'd be delighted to
make time to read and discuss the Bible with you. Our email is: This e-mail
