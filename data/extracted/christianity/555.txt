Happy New Year! May you experience God’s Wonderful Presence & enjoy His                  
Richest  Blessings in 2016.                                                              [1452136270_Special]
                                                                                          
                                                                                         [1452136286_Ps]
                                                                                          
A New Year has dawned on us: a fresh start, a new beginning, a “blank” page to           [1452136334_Ps]
write our lives. You can look forward to a brand new “YOU” as you invite God to           
transform you in the next 12 months.                                                     [1452136652_CNY]
                                                                                          
 

The church has dedicated 2016 as the Sabbath Year. This idea comes from
Leviticus 25:3-4, “For six years sow your fields, and for six years prune your
vineyards and gather their crops. But in the seventh year the land is to have a
Sabbath of rest, a   Sabbath to the Lord.”

 

It is a year devoted to the Lord. It is a year of rest and restoration. It is a
year for us to recharge and get ready to usher in EL Jubilee Year in 2017. 

                                                                                      

We live in a hardworking, fast-paced & action-packed  society that strives to
do our best and to be the best.  For 48 years, EL has followed the same trend
of doing-doing-doing.  In the 49th year, we want to stop and take a break from
the routine.  Take time to focus on God. Draw strength & direction from Him.
The Bible exhorts, “Find rest, O my soul, in God alone; my hope comes from Him
... Trust in Him at all times, O people; pour out your hearts to Him, for God
is our refuge.” Psalm 62:5, 8

 

As you enter the New Year 2016, I urge you to leave the past behind - pain,
pattern, worries & cares - and, in faith, stretch forth to receive what God has
planned for you.  He loves you as His child.  Enjoy the all-embracing love &
care of your Heavenly Father!
