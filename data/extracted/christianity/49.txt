Sisters Hospitallers of the Sacred Heart of Jesus

Welcome to the website of the English Province of the Sisters Hospitallers of
the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The Congregation of Sisters Hospitallers is an
international Religious Congregation providing health care to people with
psychiatric illnesses, people with physical and mental disabilities, people who
are elderly or suffering with dementia and people with other illnesses in
accordance with our founding charism.

From the moment of its foundation, the Congregation has had among its primary
objectives the provision of complete care and acceptance of the sick in its
centres. This offer includes the physical, psychological, social and spiritual
aspects imbued with a deeply human attitude, excellent quality of treatment and
the greatest respect for the fundamental rights of the person. We aim at caring
for the person in her/his entirety, working to maintain or reinsert the person
into society and in defence of her/his dignity.

In fulfilling our mission, we count on the support of co-workers and
volunteers, who, together with the Sisters, contribute with their professional
abilities and personal dedication to the sick, in order to attain the objective
of offering health care of the highest quality.
