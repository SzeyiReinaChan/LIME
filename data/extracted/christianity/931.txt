Welcome to the Church Planter Candidate Assessment

The Church Planter Candidate Assessment (CPCA) is a statistically validated
online assessment instrument which helps potential church planters and their
respective organizations identify areas of established strength and other areas
needing development as they prepare to plant a church.

What traits should a church planter have? Are there discernible personal
qualities evident among those who have planted successfully? LifeWay Research
endeavored to unearth the skills and mindsets common among the most proven
church planters. What resulted were specific, measurable characteristics which
were consistent among those who have had success in planting churches.

Planters, if you have already registered, you can access the assessment here.

Church planting organizations can log in here.
