Welcome to our website.

We are a Bible-believing independent Evangelical Church situated halfway
between the towns of Keighley and Skipton in the village of Crosshills.

We hold regular meetings, including for children of all ages, and we extend a
warm welcome to all. Please feel free to browse our website to find out more
about us and to listen to some of our sermons.
