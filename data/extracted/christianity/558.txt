Welcome
We are so happy you have found us! We are a United Methodist and United Church
of Christ congregation. If you are moving into the Andover area or searching
for a church home, Ballard Vale United Church offers a wonderful network of
support through worship, fellowship, service, and study opportunities. Please
come visit us!

Celebrate Diversity
We are a Reconciling/Open and Affirming congregation seeking greater
inclusiveness in our church for all persons without regard to age, disability,
economic status, ethnicity, family status, gender, race, sexual orientation or
social standing. This inclusiveness makes us an even stronger and more loving
Christian community, and is reflected in our mission statement.

Sunday 10:30am Worship
We worship together at 10:30am each Sunday morning throughout the year in a
setting which includes hymns and anthems, Scripture and sermon. We share our
faith in prayer and song. Come join us – we are a small church who welcomes
everyone with warmth and love.

Summer Worship
In July and August, we worship in Shaw Hall, accessible by the Clark Road door
(the larger of our 2 parking lots). It’s cooler and more casual than the
sanctuary for our summer months. Same time, 10:30am, please join us!
