When Paul wrote to his Christian friends in Thessalonica, he was deeply
concerned that their belief in the Gospel was demonstrated in genuine acts of
love. Our beliefs, Paul taught, should influence our behavior. Our study in
First Thessalonians continues on Truth For Life with Alistair Begg!

Belief And Behavior, Volume 1

The Thessalonian church held a tender place in the heart of the Apostle Paul.
In this expositional study of Paul’s first letter to the Thessalonians, we see
a paradigm for pastoral ministry, emphasizing the life-changing content of the
Gospel and the concerns of Paul’s heart for the healthy spiritual growth of the
individuals that make up the church body. Alistair Begg teaches from this rich
resource to help us develop an understanding of the dynamics of the Christian
life, both in what we believe and how we are to behave.

Paul was confident in the Thessalonians’ standing in Christ, and in volume one
of this series, we see his deep thankfulness and affection for these young
believers. Here we see a pastor’s careful treatment of the Gospel along with a
deep love for the Church. When Christian ministry strikes this balance, the
Church is strengthened and looks to those in leadership with respect and in
anticipation of teaching, care, and prayer.

Today’s Devotional

Speak for God

Daily Devotional Thumbnail

We ought not to court publicity for our virtue or notoriety for our zeal; but
at the same time it is a sin to be always seeking to hide what God has bestowed
upon us for the good of others. A Christian is not to be a village in a valley,
but "a city set on a hill" 1; he is not to be a candle under a bushel, but a
candle in a candlestick, giving light to all. Retirement ...
