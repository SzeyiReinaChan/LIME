      Welcome to Lyndon Independent Baptist Church. It has been my privilege to
Pastor at Lyndon for 18 years. We are a bible preaching and teaching Church
with a family atmosphere. Our goal is to lead people to know Christ Jesus as
their Savior and to feed and strengthen God's people.  We hope this site will
give you a glimpse of who we are. Please come by and visit us.        

                Yours in Christ,   

                    Pastor Kevin  Housley
