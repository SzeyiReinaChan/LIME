Baptism.png

Pastor Jim is currently in the planning process for a gathering of those
considering their own baptism or the baptism of a family member or friend.  If
you are interested in learning more about this sacrament of forgiveness,
reconciliation and new life, phone or email Pastor Jim at 616-566-6341 or
pastorjimfoster@gmail.com, to enable Pastor to schedule a time that fits into
your own schedule.

Sunday, January 24, Pastor Jim will begin his next adult forum by shining a
light on how we do church at Prince of Peace, how we live together, worship and
work to rebuild God’s creation.  We’ll explore Prince of Peace’s strengths and
how we can build on those strengths, explore the stories that define who we are
as God’s people and what it does to pass on those stories.  Our discussions
will be based on two books: A Door Set Open, by Peter Steinke, Alaban
Institute, 2010; and Generation to Generation, a textbook by Edwin Freedman.

Please join us for a New Member Conversation!  We plan to gather at 9:00 a.m.
on February 6 and start our meeting with breakfast provided by the POP

other and talk about Prince of Peace and our life together.  We should be done
around 11:00 a.m.  If you would like to have child care provided, please let us
know!  Please contact the office at 269-343-3453 or Bev Dirkin at
bdirkin@aol.com if you are interested in attending.  We will have a New Member
Reception on Sunday, February 21, to receive those who wish to become members
and welcome them with cake and coffee following the service.
