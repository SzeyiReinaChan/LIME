pour“Sharing makes you bigger than you are. The more you pour out, the more
life will be able to pour in.”

~ Jim Rohn

temp“God has more for you than plans; He also has a purposes. You do not have
to fear getting on a sidetrack when God is setting your course. If He is
speaking, listen. If He is guiding, follow. And when you arrive at the place He
has chosen, let your heart be still. He not only knows where He has taken you,
He also knows what He is doing with you while He has you there!”

~Daily Calendar

Thought for the Day

temp“I firmly believe in small gestures: pay for their coffee, hold the door
for strangers, over tip, smile or try to be kind even when you don’t feel like
it, pay compliments, chase the kid’s runaway ball down the sidewalk and throw
it back to him, try to be larger than you are— particularly when it’s
difficult. People do notice, people appreciate. I appreciate it when it’s done
to (for) me. Small gestures can be an effort, or actually go against our grain
(“I’m not a big one for paying compliments…”), but the irony is that almost
every time you make them, you feel better about yourself. For a moment life
suddenly feels lighter, a bit more Gene Kelly dancing in the rain.”

~ Author Jonathan Carroll
