Restore Your Life Today

[woman_sunr]

When you think of your life, do you liken it to a sunrise or sunset? Tomorrow
always bringing with it forgiveness, new beginnings and hope? Or is it similar
to dusk when darkness is imminent with seemingly a lifetime of hopelessness
ahead? Seeking Godly counsel
for your life will reveal truth, hope and happiness.
