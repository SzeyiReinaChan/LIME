Journey Covenant Church

Welcome to Journey Covenant

A COMMUNITY OF CHRIST FOLLOWERS ON A MISSION TO SPREAD A PASSION FOR JESUS.

JCC FOLLOWUS 320x200

JCC SERVICE 320x200 
JCC DIRECTIONS 320x200 

At Journey Covenant Church we are traveling companions on a life-changing
journey, knowing and showing Jesus.
It doesn’t matter where we started or where we come from … we share the same
destination!
We are engaged in a spiritual trek toward Christ-likeness, becoming more and
more like Jesus as we follow Him together.
Our lives are changed by knowing Jesus, and by showing Jesus.
