“Venerate the Lord, that is, Christ, in your hearts.

Should anyone ask you the reason for this hope of yours, be ever ready to
reply, but speak gently and respectfully.” (1 Peter 3:15)

Mary Our Queen Church

Welcome to Mary Our Queen

It is as a parish that we do venerate the Lord with all our heart, and as we do
this He unites us together to become His people, the people of God. As members
of a larger parish family, we share all life’s experiences together our joys
and sorrows, our growth in holiness, and the values and beliefs that we believe
as a Catholic community.

May the Lord bless our parish families, and may the Lord’s love and presence be
with us all as we continue our journey with our God together.

– Rev. Robert English
