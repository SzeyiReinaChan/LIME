                         The Secretariat of Indy Tres Días voted this year to
                         raise the fee to attend a Weekend to $100.  The fee had
LINKS                    been $70 since Indy Tres Días began, about 20 years
                         ago.  The increase was necessary to cover the
* TRES DIAS              increasing cost of holding the Weekends.  I personally
* INTERNATIONAL          know that on several Weekends, donations were accepted
* INDYRETREATS.ORG       by the Kitchen Chas from team members to help purchase
*                        additional food for the meals, because the allotted
* ONE PLACE.COM          amount was insufficient.  The fee increase will take a

                         ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
                         If you would like to communicate something to the
                         entire Tres Días Community (at least those that have
                         e-mail), send an e-mail to Tres Días Communications at
                         communications@indytresdias.com, and your message will
                         be broadcast to the Community.  There are guidelines
                         for what is appropriate to send out, and what is
                         not.  The following guidelines are reprinted from the
                         Indy Tres Días Policies & Procedures adopted on 4/7/09.


                           • Electronic communications may include news,
                             announcements, prayer requests, or other items of
                             interest to the entire Community.  However,
                             announcements about specific ministry, church,
                             social, and worthy community events not directly
                             related to Tres Días will not be published, unless
                             an exact copy of the announcement as desired for
                             publication is approved by the Secretariat.

                           • Personal sharing and testimonies by Pescadores for
                             the encouragement of the Community are welcomed.

                           • Please do not ask for prayer for someone by name in
                             the Tres Días Community (or someone generally known
                             in the Community) without asking their
                             permission.  We must obviously respect other
                             people's privacy.

                           • We will not forward chain mails or other types of
                             "impersonal" messages.  While there are many
                             generic, informative and inspirational messages
                             floating around the Internet, this is not the forum
                             to share those.

                           • You are encourage to include the Weekend number you
                             attended at the conclusion of your e-mail.  This
                             helps us to remember that we have all shared a very
                             special experience.

                           • Finally, this address may be used if you wish to
                             notify us that you would like to be added or
                             removed from the e-mail mailing list.



                         Note that this address is moderated by the
                         Communications Director, and messages deemed
                         inappropriate will not be forwarded.

                         with Tres Días!)
