EXALTING GOD BY EXPOUNDING HIS WORD
Learn More

DBTS exists for the glory of God to serve local churches by shaping faithful
men for the gospel ministry through the word of God.

At DBTS, God’s glory rules the pursuit of all other goals. Our joy is to serve
local churches by shaping faithful men for the gospel ministry through the word
of God. Our heartbeat is to exalt God by expounding his word. May God be
glorified by calling out a new generation of pastors and missionaries whose
hearts burn for the peoples and places of the earth “for the sake of his name.”
