More about Worship >>

Fellowship

In the New Testament, we find dozens of commands ending with the phrase "one
another"  like "Encourage one another" (1 Thess. 5:11).

We are committed to providing opportunities to connect and develop
relationships

More about connecting >>

Outreach

We believe in expressing our faith through our hands and feet.

We are committed to reaching out to our local community and world, and seek to
show God's love by addressing both physical and spiritual needs.
