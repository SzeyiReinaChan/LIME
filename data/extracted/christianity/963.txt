                                                    Do You Have A Dream?

                       Do you dream about being in a place where you can quit your job? Perhaps become
                       a missionary or go into full time music ministry. Perhaps you dream about
                       finding ways to make extra cash to put your kids through college. Maybe you
                       dream about being a stay at home mom, taking care of the wonderful children
                       that God has entrusted you with. Dreams….

                       Welcome to my dream – this website!

                       I love what I am doing working in Christian radio but I sometimes get anxious
                       about sending my girls to college. That’s where you, this website and SBI! Come
                       in. I love Southern Gospel music. I enjoy talking with the artists and playing
                       their music. It blesses me and it blesses those that listen. This website grew
                       out of my passion for Southern Gospel Music and my desire to start an online
                       business. SBI! Allowed me to do both.

                       SBI! Which stands for Site Build It, is a way that even the computer
                       illiterate, like myself, can build a home business on the internet that looks
                       professional and works. I love it! It works!

                       If you have ever thought about starting an online or home based business you
                       owe it to yourself and your family to check this out. I’ve clicked on a lot of
                       links looking for a home based business and I’ve attended seminars where people
                       in fancy suits tried to sell me an internet store for thousands of dollars –
                       nothing compares to SBI! It simply works.

                       Take the first step in realizing your dreams today, visit SBI!
