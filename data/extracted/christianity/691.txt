Quotes

“Bib Sac’s scholarship and insightful dialog have made a significant
contribution to our Lord’s cause.” —JOSEPH STOWELL

“Over the years I have benefited in three ways by reading Bib Sac: a better
understanding of the Word, encouragement and guidance in pastoral matters, and
direction in selecting books. I thank DTS for their investment in the lives and
ministries of God’s servants around the world.” —WARREN WIERSBE

“Bib Sac contains articles that appeal to a wide range of thoughtful
Christians. For over a century and a half it has brought both light and life to
those who read it.” —HADDON ROBINSON

“For decades Bib Sac has been a stalwart publication offering the finest
studies in theology, Bible exposition, and contemporary issues.” —CHUCK
SWINDOLL
