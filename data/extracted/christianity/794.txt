    Sermon and Illustration Mega-Database

    My sermon and illustration databases and archives are larger than ever.  A
    page that describes the various options is here.

    SID mega-database of sermons and illustrations.  You can also add your own
    material, format it, and export it so others can use it. 

    The Kerux2010 version has been updated and now has the most powerful import
    /export abilities.  Searchable, easy to update, and you can add your own
    material, too.  It is freeware like everything else at this site.

    2015 annual supplements for all three versions - SID, Kerux2010, Access2002
    - are online.   (January 6, 2016) 

    Check out who uses the SID / Kerux database around the world.  Updated on
    January 7, 2015.

    Illustration Links

    All the free sermon illustration sites I believe are worthwhile, with 40+
    listed. I include my own comments on each one. I am trying to make this the
    most comprehensive free illustration info page on the web. Some of the
    sites are not traditional illustration sources but you will find the
    material very helpful for sermons. Let me know if you come across an
    excellent site I have missed. Click here.
