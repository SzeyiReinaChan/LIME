                       Great organization and a
                       beautiful fall day made for a
                       perfect fundraising event and
                       end to the first quarter!  Thank
                       you to the many volunteers who
                       marked the Raven Run routes,
                       cheered on the students, held
                       finish line ribbons, took
                       pictures, served healthy snacks,
                       managed inflatables, and
                       assisted with supervision.
                       Families and sponsors have given
                       our PTC much needed financial
                       resources.  Net profit on the
                       event is expected to exceed
                       $5000!  Special thanks to our
                       PTC officers who organized the
                       event:  Wendy Campbell, Jen
                       Tufte, Ashly Hundley, and Laura
                       Bradfield.
