Welcome to the website for St. John the Evangelist Church in Yeadon. We are a
friendly and growing church, with people of all ages and backgrounds, and
something for everyone.

 

This site is here to help you find out more about us. There are details of our
church services and programme of events; pages on our vision and purpose;
sections on the history of the building and how it looks today; and loads of
info about the various activities we run. We hope it won't be too long before
you visit us in person. We'll be glad to meet you!
