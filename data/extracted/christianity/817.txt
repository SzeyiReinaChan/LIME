Dear Friend,

We want you to feel welcome to visit our services, yet we realize visiting a
church can be an awkward experience. Let me offer some re-assurance. We have
visitors at our service every Sunday. We are careful not to single them out,
make them uncomfortable, or acknowledge them publicly. Many people just want to
observe - to check things out. That's fine with us. We want you to feel
comfortable about dropping by some Sunday morning. Our doors are open to you.

Sincerely,
[signatur]
Mark Finn, Minister
