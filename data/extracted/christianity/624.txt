                                       Our church family would like you to know...........

           [crossm]                     

                                       Our congregation is currently under the pastoral
                                       leadership of the Reverend Mary E. Wright who
           SUNDAY WORSHIPJoin us for   specializes in transitional ministry. She has
           worship this Sunday at      undergone extensive training that includes study of
           10:00 a.m.                  conflict management, family systems, creating
                                       confidence in times of change and many other aspects
                                       of life with a congregation that is in transition.

           Sunday School for all ages   
           begins at 9:00 a.m. We
           meet in fellowship after    Pastor Mary received her M.Div. from Louisville
           worship for juice, coffee   Theological Seminary, and after 15 years of
           and snacks.                 installed pastoral ministry, discerned a call to

           A nursery is provided for   transitional pastors.  Since that time, Pastor Mary
           children to age four.       has served in several long term transitional pastor
                                       positions that have included grief work with a
                                       congregation whose pastor suddenly died, to
                                       addressing high levels of conflict.

                                       Willard-Mt. Zion Presbyterian Church is Mary's
                                       fourth congregation to serve as transitional pastor.
                                       This is a special place for Mary, for as she heard
                                       the story of the conflict and events that had
                                       happened to and through the congregation, her heart
                                       was broken for them and she was convicted that God
                                       was calling her to serve this congregation.  This
                                       sense of call continues to be very strong for Mary,
                                       and is a source of strength and wonder in her
                                       spiritual life.
            
                                        
            
                                       In the year since Pastor Mary began working with the
                                       congregation, a variety of approaches have helped
                                       the congregation to understand the nature, dynamic
                                       and effect conflict has had in the congregation for
                                       a number of years. Through our work together, we
                                       have discovered the unhealthy and confusing dynamics
                                       that a lack of faithfulness to Presbyterian polity
                                       and process can and did create in our congregation. 
                                       We have revisited our history to celebrate and to
                                       mourn, we have named our losses, and expressed
                                       frustrations and anxieties.
            
                                        
            
                                       We also engaged in a time of reminder and new
                                       education as we read the Foundation chapters of the
                                       Book of Order, which helped us re-orient to the
                                       essence of our Presbyterian heritage. However, the
                                       major outcome of that work was the re-establishment
                                       of the Session.

                                        

                                       We celebrated their election in November, 2014, and
                                       are now finding our way to becoming the new thing
                                       that God is creating among us.  Pastor Mary
                                       continues to lead us through Bible Studies,
                                       discussions, ministry projects and worship services
                                       that help us become, with God's help, the most
                                       effective, best small church ever.

                                        

                                       We welcome your interest and we NEED your prayers!

                                        

                                       May God bless you in your ministry, whatever form it
                                       takes!
